title: Mac OS 64-bit binaries

The binary package for Mac OS now includes 64-bit Intel code
(in addition to the 32-bit Intel and PowerPC code). It is available from
<a href="http://www.gecode.org/download.html">our download page</a>. If you
want to use the 64-bit version, you will have to install the
<a href="http://qt.nokia.com/downloads">Cocoa version of the Qt libraries</a>.
