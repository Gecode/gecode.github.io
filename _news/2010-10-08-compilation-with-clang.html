title: Compilation with clang
---

    Gecode successfully compiles with <a href="http://clang.llvm.org/">clang</a>, the new C++ compiler from the <a href="http://llvm.org/">llvm</a> project. The clang compiler is about three times as fast as gcc when compiling Gecode. The generated code seems to be slightly slower than the one generated by gcc (but with llvm being a very active project, we expect performance to improve).
