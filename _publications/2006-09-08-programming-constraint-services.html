<p>
Constraint programming is an approach to modeling and solving
combinatorial problems that has proven succesful in many
applications. Building on techniques developed in AI, logic
programming and operations research, constraint programming is based
on an abstraction that decomposes the problem solver into a reusable
constraint engine and a declarative program modeling the problem.
</p>
<p>
This book is concerned with the architecture and implementation of
constraint engines. The author's main contribution is that constraint
services, such as search and combinators, are made programmable; this
is achieved by devising computation spaces as simple abstraction for
programming constraint services at a high level. State-of-the-art and
novel search strategies, such as visual interactive search and
parallel search are covered.

<p>
The book is indispensible reading for anyone seriously interested in
constraint technology.
