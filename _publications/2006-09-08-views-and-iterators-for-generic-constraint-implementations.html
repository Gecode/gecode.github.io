<p>    
  This paper introduces an architecture for generic constraint
  implementations based on variable views and range iterators.  Views
  allow, for example, to scale, translate, and negate variables. The
  paper shows how to make constraint implementations generic and how
  to reuse a single generic implementation with different views for
  different constraints.  A wide range of applications of views
  exemplifies their usefulness and their potential for simplifying
  constraint implementations.  We introduce domain operations
  compatible with views based on range iterators.  The paper evaluates
  the applicability of the approach as well as different
  implementation techniques for the presented architecture.
