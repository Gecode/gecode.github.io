<p>    
  While incremental propagation for global constraints is
  recognized to be important, little research has been devoted to
  how propagator-centered constraint programming systems should
  support incremental propagation.  This paper introduces
  advisors as a simple and efficient, yet widely applicable
  method for supporting incremental propagation in a
  propagator-centered setting. The paper presents how advisors
  can be used for achieving different forms of incrementality and
  evaluates cost and benefit for several global constraints.
