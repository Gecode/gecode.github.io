  How to correctly implement set propagators

<p>    
  Ideally, programming propagators as implementations of
  constraints should be an entirely declarative specification process
  for a large class of constraints: a high-level declarative
  specification is automatically translated into an efficient
  propagator. This paper introduces the use of existential
  monadic second-order logic as declarative
  specification language for finite set propagators. The approach taken in
  the paper is to automatically derive projection propagators (involving a
  single variable only) implementing
  constraints described by formulas. By this, the paper
  transfers the ideas of indexicals to finite set constraints
  while considerably increasing the level of
  abstraction available with indexicals. The paper proves soundness
  and completeness of the derived propagators and presents a run-time
  analysis, including techniques for efficiently executing projectors
  for <i>n</i>-ary constraints.
