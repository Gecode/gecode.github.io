<p>
There is no standard modelling language for constraint
programming (CP) problems. Most solvers have their own modelling
language. This makes it difficult for modellers to experiment
with different solvers for a problem.
</p>
<p>
In this paper we present MiniZinc, a simple but expressive CP
modelling language which is suitable for modelling problems for a
range of solvers and provides a reasonable compromise between
many design possibilities. Equally importantly, we also propose a
low-level solver-input language called FlatZinc, and a
straightforward translation from MiniZinc to FlatZinc that
preserves all solver-supported global constraints.
</p>
<p>
This lets a solver writer support MiniZinc with a minimum of
effort - they only need to provide a simple FlatZinc front-end to
their solver, and then combine it with an existing
MiniZinc-to-FlatZinc translator. Such a front-end may then serve
as a stepping stone towards a full MiniZinc implementation that
is more tailored to the particular solver.
</p>
<p>
A standard language for modelling CP problems will encourage
experimentation with and comparisons between different
solvers. Although MiniZinc is not perfect - no standard modelling
language will be - we believe its simplicity, expressiveness, and
ease of implementation make it a practical choice for a standard
language.
