<p>
The regular constraint is a powerful global constraint with many
possible uses. It was introduced to model certain common constraints
in rostering problems.  In this paper we show how to use it to model
placement problems with irregular shapes.  The technique is
illustrated by solving Pentominoes and Solitaire Battleships. The
efficiency of the basic model is improved by projecting out irrelevant
information.  Experimental results on Pentomino packing benchmark
instances indicate that this simple approach can be competitive with
specialized algorithms.  From the applications we can identify some
areas for improvement in the implementation of regular constraints.
