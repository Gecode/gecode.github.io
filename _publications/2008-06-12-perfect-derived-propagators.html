<p>    
  When implementing a propagator for a constraint, one must decide about
  variants: When implementing min, should one also implement max? Should one
  implement linear equations both with and without coefficients? Constraint
  variants are ubiquitous: implementing them requires considerable (if not
  prohibitive) effort and decreases maintainability, but will deliver better
  performance.

  This paper shows how to use variable views, previously introduced for an
  implementation architecture, to derive perfect propagator variants. A model
  for views and derived propagators is introduced. Derived propagators are
  proved to be indeed perfect in that they inherit essential properties such
  as correctness and domain and bounds consistency. Techniques for
  systematically deriving propagators such as transformation, generalization,
  specialization, and channeling are developed for several variable domains.
  We evaluate the massive impact of derived propagators. Without derived
  propagators, Gecode would require 140000 rather than 40000 lines of code for
  propagators.
