<p>    
  This paper presents a model and implementation techniques for
  speeding up constraint propagation.  Three fundamental
  approaches to improving constraint propagation based on
  propagators as implementations of constraints are explored:
  keeping track of which propagators are at fixpoint, choosing
  which propagator to apply next, and how to combine several
  propagators for the same constraint.
</p>
<p>
  We show how idempotence reasoning and events help track
  fixpoints more accurately.  We improve these methods by using
  them dynamically (taking into account current domains to
  improve accuracy).  We define priority-based approaches to
  choosing a next propagator and show that dynamic priorities can
  improve propagation.  We illustrate that the use of multiple
  propagators for the same constraint can be advantageous with
  priorities, and introduce staged propagators that combine the
  effects of multiple propagators with priorities for greater
  efficiency.
