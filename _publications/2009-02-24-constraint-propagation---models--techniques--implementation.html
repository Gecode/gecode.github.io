This dissertation presents the design of a propagation-based constraint solver.
The design is based on models that span several levels of abstraction, ranging
from a mathematical foundation, to a high-level implementation architecture, to
concrete data structures and algorithms. This principled design approach results
in a well-understood, correct, modular, and efficient implementation.
</p><p>
The core of the developed architecture is the <i>propagation kernel</i>. It
provides the propagation infrastructure and is thus crucial for correctness and
efficiency of the solver. Based on a mathematical model as well as a careful
design of the employed algorithms and data structures, the presented
architecture results in an efficient and domain-independent kernel. Constraints
are realized by propagators, and implementing a propagator is a challenging,
error-prone, and time-consuming task. A practically useful solver must however
provide a comprehensive propagator library. This dissertation introduces two
techniques for <i>automatically deriving</i> correct and efficient propagators.
<i>Views</i> generalize variables and are used to derive propagators from
existing propagators. For constraints over set variables, propagators are
derived from formal <i>constraint specifications</i>.
</p><p>
The presented techniques are the basis of Gecode, a production-quality, highly
efficient, and widely deployed constraint solver. Gecode is the empirical
evidence for success and relevance of the principled design approach of this
dissertation.
