This thesis explores three new techniques for increasing the efficiency
of constraint propagation: support for incremental propagation, improved 
representation of constraints, and abstractions to simplify propagation.
</p><p>
    Support for incremental propagation is added to a propagator-centered 
propagation system by adding a new intermediate layer of
abstraction, advisors, that capture the essential aspects of a variable-
centered system. Advisors are used to give propagators a detailed view
of the dynamic changes between propagator runs. Advisors enable the
implementation of optimal algorithms for important constraints such
as extensional constraints and Boolean linear in-equations, which is
not possible in a propagator-centered system lacking advisors.
</p><p>
    Using Multivalued Decision Diagrams (MDD) as the representation 
for extensional constraints is shown to be useful for several reasons. 
Classical operations on MDDs can be used to optimize the representation, 
and thus speeding up the propagation. In particular, the
reduction operation is stronger than the use of DFA minimization for
the regular constraint. The use of MDDs is contrasted and compared
to a recent proposal where tables are compressed.
</p><p>
    Abstractions for constraint programs try to capture small and 
essential features of a model. These features may be much cheaper to
propagate than the unabstracted program. The potential for abstraction 
is explored using several examples.
</p><p>
    These three techniques work on different levels. Support for 
incremental propagation is essential for the efficient implementation of
some constraints, so that the algorithms have the right complexity. On
a higher level, the question of representation looks at what a propagator 
should use for propagation. Finally, the question of abstraction can
potentially look at several propagators, to find cases where abstractions
might be fruitful.
</p><p>
    An essential feature of this thesis is an novel model for general
placement constraints that uses regular expressions. The model is very
versatile and can be used for several different kinds of placement 
problems. The model applied to the classic pentominoes puzzle will be used
through-out the thesis as an example and for experiments.
