<p>    
  Today's models for propagation-based constraint solvers require
  propagators as implementations of constraints to be at least
  contracting and monotonic.  These models do not comply with
  reality: today's constraint programming systems actually use
  <em>non-monotonic</em> propagators.  This paper introduces the
  first realistic model of constraint propagation by assuming a
  propagator to be <em>weakly monotonic</em> (complying with the
  constraint it implements).  Weak monotonicity is shown to be
  the minimal property that guarantees constraint propagation to
  be sound and complete.  The important insight is that weak
  monotonicity makes propagation <em>in combination</em> with search well
  behaved.  A case study suggests that non-monotonicity can be
  seen as an opportunity for more efficient propagation.
