Constraint propagation solvers interleave propagation, removing
impossible values from variable domains, with search.  The solver
state is modified during propagation.  But search requires the
solver to return to a previous state. Hence a propagation solver
must determine how to maintain state during propagation and
forward and backward search.  This paper sets out the possible
ways in which a propagation solver can choose to maintain state,
and the restrictions that such choices place on the resulting
system.  Experiments illustrate the result of various choices for
the three principle state components of a solver: variables,
propagators, and dependencies between them.  This paper also
provides the first realistic comparison of trailing versus
copying for state restoration.
