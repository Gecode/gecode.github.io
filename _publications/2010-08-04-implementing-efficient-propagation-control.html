<p>
  In propagation-based constraint solvers, propagators implement constraints
  by removing inconsistent values from variable domains. To make propagation
  efficient, modern constraint solvers employ two mechanisms of propagation
  control, event-based and prioritized propagation. Events, such as a bounds
  change of a particular variable, control which propagators need to be
  scheduled for re-evaluation. Prioritization controls which of the scheduled
  propagators is executed next.
</p>
<p>
  While it has been shown that the combination of event-based and
  priority-based scheduling is an efficient approach for propagation control,
  this is the first publication on the implementation details of such a
  system.
</p>
<p>
  This paper presents the design of efficient data structures for propagator
  priority queues and the event system. The paper introduces the notions of
  modification events and propagation conditions, which refine the event-based
  model of propagation and yield an efficient implementation. The presented
  architecture is the basis of Gecode.
