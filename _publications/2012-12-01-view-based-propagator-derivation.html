<p>	     
  When implementing a propagator for a constraint, one must
  decide about variants: When implementing min, should one
  also implement max?  Should one implement linear constraints
  both with unit and non-unit coefficients?  Constraint variants
  are ubiquitous: implementing them requires considerable (if not
  prohibitive) effort and decreases maintainability, but will
  deliver better performance than resorting to constraint
  decomposition.

  This paper shows how to use <em>views</em> to <em>derive</em> propagator
  variants, combining the efficiency of dedicated propagator implementations
  with the simplicity and effortlessness of decomposition.

<p>
  A model for views and derived propagators
  is introduced. Derived propagators are proved to be 
  <em>perfect</em> in that they inherit essential properties such as
  correctness and domain and bounds consistency. Techniques for
  systematically deriving propagators such as transformation,
  generalization, specialization, and type conversion are
  developed. The paper introduces an implementation architecture
  for views that is independent of the underlying constraint
  programming system.  A detailed evaluation of views implemented
  in Gecode shows that derived propagators are efficient and that
  views often incur no overhead. Views have proven essential for implementing 
  Gecode, substantially reducing the amount of code that needs to be written 
  and maintained.
