  <h3>Does Gecode have bugs?</h3>

  <p>To quote from <em>Modeling with Gecode</em>:</p>

  <p>
  Yes, of course! But, Gecode is very thoroughly tested (tests cover almost
  100%) and extensively used (several thousand users). If something does not
  work, we regret to inform you that this is most likely due to your program
  and not Gecode. Again, this does not mean that Gecode has no bugs. But it
  does mean that it might be worth searching for errors in your program first.
  </p>
  
  <p>
  And, yes. Please take our apologies in advance if that somewhat bold claim
  does turn out to be false... If you have accepted our apologies, you can
  submit your bug report below.
  </p>

  <h3>Already fixed?</h3>
  
  <p>
  Please have a look at the <a href="current.html">changes in the 
  development trunk</a>, maybe the bug you want to report has already been 
  fixed.
