  <h3>Questions and Answers</h3>

  <p>You can contact the Gecode developers and users via
  a Google group. But, please make sure to not waste your 
  time and the time of others:</p>
  
  <ul>
  <li>Please check <a href="documentation.html">Gecode's 
      documentation</a> first.</li>
  <li>Please check previous discussions in the <a
  href="https://groups.google.com/d/forum/gecode">
  Gecode Google Group</a>.</li>
  <li>You can also have a look at the <a href="users-archive/">archive of the old Gecode users' mailing list</a>. It is a little messy but useful!</li>
  <li>Please focus on questions specific to Gecode. For general
      questions about constraint programming more suitable forums
      exist.</li>
  <li>Please provide sufficient detail: describe your platform
      (operating system, compiler, Gecode version) and your problem
      (what does not work, what do you want to do, what is the
      problem you observe) as accurately as you can.</li>
  <li>Please do not contact individual developers: it
  is much better to build a comprehensive archive of questions and
  answers related to Gecode that can be useful for everyone.
  If you have any questions not suitable for the public group,
  please do not hesitate to contact one of the authors directly.</li>
  <li>Never ask for solutions to homework. The only more
  offensive thing you could do is to provide a solution on the
  group if someone has violated the no homework policy!</li>
  </ul>
