  <p>
    Gecode {{ GECODESTAMP }} has been released on
    {{ GECODECLEARDATE }} (<a href="changes.html">Changelog</a>).
    Gecode is distributed under the MIT license. See our
    <a href="license.html">license information page</a> for details.
    If you find any bugs, please report them using
  <a href="https://github.com/Gecode/gecode/issues">the Gecode issue page on GitHub</a>.
  </p>

  <p>
  Please refer to Section 2.6 of <a href="doc-latest/MPG.pdf"
  >Modeling and Programming with Gecode</a> for additional
  installation and compilation instructions.
  </p>

  <p>Gecode comes with an interpreter for the FlatZinc language (see our
    <a href="flatzinc.html">FlatZinc page</a> for details). It currently 
    supports FlatZinc version {{ GECODEFLATZINCVERSION }}.
  </p>

  <h3>Binary Packages (Version {{ GECODESTAMP }})</h3>

  <ul>
  <li>Microsoft Windows: the packages assume that you have the appropriate version of Microsoft Visual Studio installed. If not (maybe you only want to use the FlatZinc interpreter) you might have to install the Visual C++ Redistributable Packages for <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=48145">Visual Studio 2015</a> or <a href="https://www.visualstudio.com/downloads/">Visual Studio 2017</a>.</li>
  <ul>
  <li>Windows x64 (64 bit, MSVC 2015): 
    {% include download.html link=GECODEWIN15 stamp=GECODESTAMP %}.
  <li>Windows x64 (64 bit, MSVC 2017): 
    {% include download.html link=GECODEWIN17 stamp=GECODESTAMP %}.
  </ul>
  <li>Mac OS X &ge; 10.8 (Intel 64 bit only):
    {% include download.html link=GECODEMAC stamp=GECODESTAMP %}.
      This package includes the 
      <a href="http://qt-project.org/">Qt library</a>, no separate download is needed. Note: The code has been compiled with the Apple clang C++ compiler, which currently seems to cause problems with some float and set constraints.
  </li>
  <li>Linux and FreeBSD: while packages for many Linux distributions
    (Debian, Ubuntu, Gentoo, OpenSUSE, and most likely others) and FreeBSD exist, these packages often lag behind by several versions. If you prefer an up-to-date version (which you definitely should), please consider building Gecode from source.</li>
  </ul>

  <p>
   The binary packages for Windows and Mac OS include some parts
   of the <a href="http://qt-project.org/">Qt library</a> which
   is licensed under the <a href="https://opensource.org/licenses/lgpl-license">GNU Lesser General Public License
   (LGPL)</a>, for more details read about <a
   href="https://www.qt.io/qt-licensing-terms/">Qt's licensing
   terms</a>. Additionally, the Windows binary is statically
   linked against the <a
   href="http://www.mpfr.org/">MPFR</a> and 
   <a href="http://www.mpir.org">MPIR</a> libraries which
   are also both licensed under the <a href="https://opensource.org/licenses/lgpl-license">GNU Lesser General Public License
   (LGPL)</a>.
