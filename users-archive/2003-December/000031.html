Hm, according to Tobias' thesis it's &quot;subset of union&quot; and &quot;superset of 
intersection&quot; ?!? ;-)

Hm, maybe I should try to explain this in a bit more detailed way:

A propagator subscribes to certain modification events (MEs) of a variable, so 
that it is only invoked if that event has occured. All finite set MEs have to 
be represented using 3 bits, we chose &quot;nothing happened&quot;, &quot;failure&quot;, 
&quot;assigned&quot;, &quot;lower bound changed&quot;, &quot;upper bound changed&quot;, &quot;both bounds 
changed&quot;. So there are only two more MEs, which is not enough to encode 
combinations of the above with,e.g., &quot;cardinality changed&quot;. This is our main 
technical argument against representing cardinality in a core set variable.

Of course this makes the cardinality propagators a bit less efficient than 
possible: Everytime the bounds change, they have to be invoked and test 
whether the cardinality changed as well - this cannot be done by the tell 
operations of the core fs variable.

Is it true that in Mozart, no cardinality information is propagated at all 
unless you explicitly create a cardinality variable? We could easily follow 
that model (and you gave a good reason to do so).
