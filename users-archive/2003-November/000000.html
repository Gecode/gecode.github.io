<PRE>Hej everybody,

[Gabor: I am sending the answer to the gecode list as it might be of general
interest]

And of course my aplogies for delay.

Christian

&gt;<i> I added my first propagator, try examples/power1 and power2. 
</I>&gt;<i> Don't look at the &quot;algorithm&quot;, I only care about using the interfaces 
</I>&gt;<i> properly for now.
</I>&gt;<i> I shamelessly copied everything from your code, and then spent 2 days 
</I>&gt;<i> trying to understand what I did :-)
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Questions:
</I>&gt;<i> 0,
</I>&gt;<i> I used the eclipse.org IDE, did it do anything nasty to the 
</I>&gt;<i> source that 
</I>&gt;<i> bothers you? (CR/LFs, tabs to spaces, etc)
</I>&gt;<i> I can try to configure it more, or just ditch it and learn 
</I>&gt;<i> Emacs :-)
</I>
As I am using Windows, the sources are mistreated anyway.
 
&gt;<i> 1, If a propagator wants to replace itself with a 
</I>&gt;<i> simpler one, do you use 
</I>&gt;<i> the post functions from the API or create the propagator 
</I>&gt;<i> instance directly? 2, (dual of 1,) Do you put the &quot;first 
</I>&gt;<i> time&quot; smartness into the post functions or the 
</I>&gt;<i> propagator constructors?
</I>&gt;<i> I mean I've seen it in a post function, but was that by design?
</I>
YOU CAN'T USE THE POST FUNCTIONS FROM THE API! The reason is that they
actually work on different datastructures for passing arguments.

The right architecture should be as follows:
 1. The API function does preprocessing on the arguments, creates the
appropriate variable arrays to be passed to the propagators proper.
    The last point happens automatically when implicitly casting a IntArgs
to VarArray&lt;IntVar&gt;.
    Then, a propagator-based (maybe a static method) post-method is invoked.

 2. Then the propagator-based post-method decides what is the right
propagtor (typically some appropriate variant) to create.

 3. The propagator constructor does the real job of initializing a
propagator.

Unfortunately, quite often I have combined 2. and 3. This needs to be fixed
eventually.

Now getting back to your real question: Typically, you will go for 3. when
replacing a propgator. You never go for 1. as you don't want to create new
variable arrays (they are just resued for the newly created propagator). So,
in a fixed system you would also have the choice between 2. and 3.

&gt;<i> 3,
</I>&gt;<i> How would you &quot;cast&quot; an IntVar into a BoolVar?
</I>&gt;<i> My propagator wants to replace itself with a reified 
</I>&gt;<i> constraint: 0^b=c  &lt;=&gt;  c=(b==0) 4, (generalisation of 3,) Do 
</I>&gt;<i> you have a short summary or some easy to read code about the 
</I>&gt;<i> relationships of the different types related to domain 
</I>&gt;<i> variables and how 
</I>&gt;<i> to convert between them?
</I>&gt;<i> [Core](Int|Bool)Var ...
</I>&gt;<i> Something tells me a bool is just an int but you exploit knowing it's 
</I>&gt;<i> 0/1 valued statically :-)
</I>
You are right, the difference is just in the static type-system.

Hmmm, don't know. What needs to be done is adding an implicit constructor to
BoolVar taking an IntVar as argument. If you like, you can try that. What
will happen is easy: You just create a boolvar (and might even check by
assertions that it satisifies the 0/1 restrictions). Remember it is just a
pointer to a CoreIntVar.

&gt;<i> 5,
</I>&gt;<i> I know this is a stupid question, maybe I just did not sleep 
</I>&gt;<i> enough: I don't understand why doing ceil/floor on integer 
</I>&gt;<i> valued floats works.  
</I>&gt;<i> Looks like the 100dB amplification of Braun noise to me, but 
</I>&gt;<i> I'm just an 
</I>&gt;<i> engineer... ;-)
</I>&gt;<i> I mean it's pot luck whether floor(ln(4.0)/ln(2.0))  is 1 or 
</I>&gt;<i> 2, right? 6, Do you have any preference in unit testing 
</I>&gt;<i> frameworks? Anything against 
</I>&gt;<i> CppUnit?
</I>
Yes, might be. But maybe that means you have to resort to exact algorithms
(integer-based) for log (ld). Why ln to start with?
