<PRE>I tried to subscribe to the gecode mailing list, but I'm not sure if
it's worked.

Sounds good.

Yes, please do that.

Yes, this is the usual approach for interfacing with the Mercury trail.
The question is whether it is likely to be feasible for gecode, and
whether there is a better way to do it.

&gt;<i> What worries me a little bit is to have to deal with the current cpi. Would
</I>&gt;<i> it be possible for you to do something for HAL which uses what I have been
</I>&gt;<i> describing in my previous Email.
</I>
I am a bit unclear exactly what you meant by your previous description.
I.e. who is is responsible for each of the steps you mention (create
choice point and return cpi, check for failure, go back to a cpi)?

&gt;<i> &gt; What we want to be able to do is have a number of &quot;delay 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; conditions&quot; which can be used to delay a goal until a 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; condition is satisfied.  For a FD solver, we want (at least) 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; these conditions:
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 	fixed(X):	The value of the variable X becomes fixed.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 	ubc(X):		The upper bound of X changes.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 	lbc(X):		The lower bound of X changes.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 	dc(X):		The domain of X changes.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; One way to do this would be to associate 4 lists of goals 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; with each variable (i.e. one list for each delay condition).  
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Each operation that constrains the variable would then need 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; to check these 4 lists and execute the relevant goals.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Okay, I think I get it. How about the following intermediate interface:
</I>&gt;<i> after Gecode has computed a fixpoint, it returns a list of modifed variables
</I>&gt;<i> together with how they have been modfied. From that list you then choose
</I>&gt;<i> which goals to run. Is that okay? Or do I miss something here?
</I>
That is likely to be quite expensive, I think.  It would require
scanning that list of variables to determine which ones have goals
delayed on them.  Peter Stuckey's idea is to add a special kind of
&quot;propagator&quot; which is responsible for calling the goals.  Is that
approach likely to work?
