Subject: [Gecode] Diff between gecode head and gecode fs branch merged with
	head
Message-ID: <406C381C.6000103@ps.uni-sb.de>

Hi!

Here's a diff between the current head, and what would be in CVS if we 
decided to merge.
Except gcc has issues with some of the examples that use the new 
ArgArray interface, and our examples do not compile because they use the 
old one.
The merge itself was automatic, painless, but we have not tried if it 
still works yet, compiles "just as good" as the head.

It's 70KB, should fit in everyones mailbox unless some people have 
friends with a strange sense of humor on April 1st.
Most of it is the Alice binding though as our new files were omitted. 
(the whole fs subdirectory)

$ diff -r -x CVS -I "\*[ ]*\\$" gecodeHead gecode >difference

Some quick questions:
 - Why did you change the use of Arith::max (and min)? Don't, Arith::max and
min avoid branching.
 - Please adhere to the indentation style as used elsewhere (so we can all
read easily)
 - NEVER USE MALLOC! Please use Memory::alloc (that gives us central control
over allocation)
 - Why have <iostream> in the kernel? If you used for testing, remove.

That's it.

They give unexpected results for integers that are big.
We can change back, but we have to figure out in what range they work, 
and limit domains of variables to be smaller than that.

Do you use any automatic code formatter/beautifyer?

We'll look at the allocation of the dummy varmodboard again.

Subject: [Gecode] One constraint = multiple propagators
Message-ID: <200404201555.48060.tack@ps.uni-sb.de>

Hi!

We have implemented some constraints as multiple propagators, one for each 
propagation rule, to make them react to more specific modification events. 
This raises two questions:
* Efficiency: Multiple propagators need more memory for dependencies and more 
time during copying. This can become really expensive, as we have seen for 
the intersection constraint. Should we make different versions of constraints 
available, one that does everything in a single propagator, and one that 
reacts to specific events? Any idea how to find out what makes more sense?
* Entailment: How do we check that the whole constraint is entailed, or 
replace several propagators by a simpler one? Example: A selection constraint 
that notices that the selector variable is determined could be replaced by 
just a union or whatever. We could either check for entailment in every 
propagator, and let only one of them create the replacement propagator(s), or 
have some common variable that they use to communicate (again quite 
expensive...)

Another thing that is not quite clear to us is whether there is any way for a 
propagator to find out which variables really triggered what propagation 
conditions. This could be used to use a single propagator for multiple 
propagation rules.

Regards,

	Guido

Actually, I just submitted a paper the other day that works that out. As the
paper is still under review, I'll just send it to Guido, other people
interested, please get to my be Email.

The key idea (which is already supported in Gecode) is that a propagator can
find out about the event which has triggered it. However what is not yet
done is that also the variable is known. But typically one can emulate that
by putting some state into a propahator.

If you look for an example look to the #ifedf STAGED_PROPAGATORS part in
int/distinct/dom.icc

Dear all,

some restructuring has been done (as told):

	MallocCaches are gone
	
	PropHeap and ScrapHeap is gone

	what used to be called generic is now kernel, what used to be kernel
is core...

That's it

I also changed the followin:

By the last one I for sure broke the alice interface. Guido: please check.

Mamemory management (at least the basic stuff) is now part of the kernel.
Otherwise, the structure to do DLLs for the stuff becomes too complicated...

Also, I renamed gecode.hh to gecode-kernel.hh. Whenever you include
gecode-kernel.hh you also have the proper memory management stuff available.
You SHALL NOT USE new! If you wish, redefine it in memoery.hh

Message-ID: <4090D342.7010006@ps.uni-sb.de>

Hello!

We merged our Finite Set development branch back to head today.
Among other things, this includes our autoconf/automake based build 
system that can produce static libraries under Linux and Cygwin with gcc 
or the intel compiler.

We'll harmonise it with Christians ongoing DLL building efforts, but for 
now you have to get rid of all dllinport/export declarations for it to 
work under cygwin.

As a sidenote, we can build dynamic libraries under Linux if statistics 
are disabled (nasty uninitialised global state there...)

The main modification to the core system is the controlled 
initialisation of Variable::vmb so applications that do not link both 
int and set  support still work.

The curious can try the examples we added...


Gabor & Guido

Let's not jump here, there is no problem... At least to those compared under
Windows. Actually, the statistics will change its implementation to avoid
the problem right from the start.

I didn't intend to jump into anything - I was just wondering what the
technical problem was in relation with dynamic libraries - this is
just personal curiosity.

The technical problem seemed to have something to do with a global variable 
which was duplicated in two object files. So it got initialized in one part 
but not in the other - where it is later accessed. Christian is right, there 
really is no problem because we know what we'd have to change, but let's 
focus on the other issues first.
