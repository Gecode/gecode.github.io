<PRE>Hi!

Here's a diff between the current head, and what would be in CVS if we 
decided to merge.
Except gcc has issues with some of the examples that use the new 
ArgArray interface, and our examples do not compile because they use the 
old one.
The merge itself was automatic, painless, but we have not tried if it 
still works yet, compiles &quot;just as good&quot; as the head.

It's 70KB, should fit in everyones mailbox unless some people have 
friends with a strange sense of humor on April 1st.
Most of it is the Alice binding though as our new files were omitted. 
(the whole fs subdirectory)

$ diff -r -x CVS -I &quot;\*[ ]*\\$&quot; gecodeHead gecode &gt;difference
