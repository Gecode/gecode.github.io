Subject: [Gecode] CVS log mailing list
Message-ID: <200408031131.56551.tack@ps.uni-sb.de>

I have added a new mailing list, gecode-cvs, that contains all log messages 
from the gecode CVS. You can subscribe to the list through
http://www.ps.uni-sb.de/mailman/listinfo/gecode-cvs

The archives are currently private, so you have to subscribe to see them - we 
could of course change that, because currently all cvs logs are public anyway 
on ps.cvs - btw, is that group really supposed to be publically available?

I haven't yet shut down the logging to the ps.cvs newsgroup, because I'm not 
100% sure that the mailing list solution is completely satisfying... Just try 
it and let me know what you think about it.

Probably not.  I therefore changed this, adopting the policy that world 
can only read publicly advertised newsgroups.

Subject: [Gecode] Important change for commiting to alternatives
Message-ID: <000501c48455$a9687ba0$acd4ed82@beule>

Dear all,

I just rectified an annoying design inconsistency in the way how commit for
spaces and branchings has been handeled: for a space with n alternatives the
alternatives were referred to by 1...n (which is of course bad in a C/C++
context). I fixed it to go from 0...(n-1).

This means that you have to adapt the search engines in Alice.

Cheers
Christian

Subject: [Gecode] Unary branchings...
Message-ID: <000701c4846b$1dab28e0$acd4ed82@beule>

Dear all,

the kernel used to handle unary branchings (useful for assigning values
determinstically after propagation has stopped) implicitly. However, this
idea clashes with batch recomputation.

Therefore, every search engine must be prepared to handle unary branchings:
in particulat, watch out that you don't waste stack space for these guys if
you don't have to.

Subject: [Gecode] New variable/view structure in place
Message-ID: <200408201944.13890.tack@ps.uni-sb.de>

Hi everyone.

I updated the sets to reflect a new structure concerning variables and views:

* Variables are the things a user sees, they have a read-only interface, and    
they can be used to post propagators and branchings
* Views are the things that propagators work on.

So far, only the sets have been adjusted to the new schema. The system 
compiles, both with gcc and cl.

Subject: [Gecode] Fundamental change of managing the current space
Message-ID: <000a01c48eca$b58b26b0$579ee151@dator>

Dear all,

One deficiency of the gecode design has been that it relied on a global
variable refering to the current space. This has been done just out of
laziness and now was the time to do it right (TM).

Now all operations which need access to the current space (that is
pretty much everything as one gets the memory from the current space)
take as first argument 'Space* home': the home will always refer to the
current space.

The rewrite has been brutal, Guido is still working on the set stuff...
And there has to be done alittle more to the notification boards and
propagator pools (also global state). This will be done by introducing a
worker which comprises all the state required to perform copying and
propagation.

The advantages of course are clear: no problems on Windows any longer
with gcc. And, most notably, now the way is open for parallel search
engines using several threads running in parallel. Interestingly, the
kernel will be completely ignorant of any parallelism, all this is
encapsulated in the search engine.

Subject: [Gecode] Some minor changes...
Message-ID: <000b01c48ecb$5c00ad30$579ee151@dator>

Dear all,

In order to make things more consistent, I did the following:

 - ME_GEN_FALSE, me_false are now called ME_GEN_FAILED, me_failed (to be
consistent with the ExecStatus).
 - The different status types for posting, propagation, committing, etc
has been unified to a single type ExecStatus.
   The macros have been adopted accordingly.
 - BranchDesc is now BranchingDesc (as it does not provide information
about a single branch but an entire node!)
 - Abstractions for common branchings (variable, value selection) have
been added
 - And more stuff.

What I am still thinking about is to rename priority in cost (after all,
it is about cost!): currently BINARY_HI means high cost but low
priority. So also misnomed. Don't know wether I want to change to cost.

I also fixed a major bug in processing the modified set variables: here
the event was always assigned...

Cheers
Christian

I for one welcome our new explicit parameter :-)

As of this morning, I beleive to have adapted the automake process and 
the alice binding.
If build problems persist, let me know.

Please don't commit anything else for the next hour or so. I've got quite a 
lot of changes, and the recent check ins really messed up everything here. 
I've been chasing conflicts now for half an hour already...

You can roll it back if you want to, my changes are tiny, they only took 
forever to find, but won't take too much effort for me to apply again if 
needed.
A snapshot before 8am this morning should be clean from my meddling.

Are you working on the binding or the makefiles?
Christian said you were working on sets, so I thought these were left to 
me, sorry.

It was not only your check ins, but also Christian's that broke what I had in 
the queue. I updated the complete set stuff to use the new scheme, and 
changed the binding and Makefiles accordingly. Problem is that I did that 
yesterday evening (or night, really ;-) and I can't check in from my hotel 
room.
