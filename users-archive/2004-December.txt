Hi everyone.

We are releasing Alice today, including something like a "technology 
preview" or "Christmas present" release of Gecode in binary-only form.
As the Gecode web site is now mentioned officially somewhere, I thought 
it might be a good idea to make it at least look a little nicer. I took 
the current "working design", changed the text on the home page and 
disabled all the links - but it will give users an idea what to expect 
now. I hope this is ok with all of you.

Cheers,
	Guido
