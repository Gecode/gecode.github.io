<PRE>Hello All!

On  Thursday, January 29, I will give a talk on the Alice/Gecode interface. 
Afterwards, Gabor will bring you up to date with our work on Finite Integer 
Set Constraints for Gecode. 

Time: Thursday, January 29, 2004, 2:15 pm
Location: PS Lab Seminar Room (528), as usual.

Abstract for the first talk:
Gecode, the Generic Constraint Development Environment, is the 
not-yet-released but probably most advanced system for constraint programming 
available. It is being developed by Christian Schulte at KTH, Stockholm, 
Sweden.
The talk will provide an overview of what has to be done to connect the Gecode 
library to other systems in general, and in particular to Alice/SEAM. Covered 
topics include memory management, concurrency issues, implementation of 
search engines and the high-level view on Gecode available from the Alice 
language.

Something about the second talk:
The Gecode library was created with multiple variable types in mind. As 
a proof-of-concept implementation we are adding Finite Set constraints 
to it. This is a short term intensive learning experience for us about 
Gecode internals, and with time it will evolve into a production quality 
implementation. The talk will summarise the current status and expected 
future development.
