Ok, that is exactly as I would have thought.

I will try. I guess with these explanations it should be easy, but I'm sure I 
would have screwed up things badly again if I hadn't known the details ;-)

It still feels a bit weird to use a VarArray only to store the variables that 
are needed to reconstruct the cache instead of storing them in a list in the 
first place, however...

&gt;<i> Otherwise, there is no need to use freelists. As you rightly say, the lists
</I>&gt;<i> shrink. That's fine. Freelists are very special beasts (there are only size
</I>&gt;<i> 8 and 16 freelists). Don't use them if you don't have to. I use them for
</I>&gt;<i> rangelists as they have the property to grow and not to shrink.

I see. Good to know.
