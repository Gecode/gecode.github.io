I think this was intended to be a specialized version. The problem was that 
you relied on the two arguments being of the same type to exchange them 
(using Common::swap), that's why we had to split it in a generic and a 
specialised version. The code compiled and worked, although I don't know at 
all what the msvc might think about it...

&gt;<i> The max and min double values are exactly those for which floating point
</I>&gt;<i> arithmetic is exact. Basing the configuration on the fact that long long is
</I>&gt;<i> 64 bits is worse than using the predefined constant (which is guaranteed by
</I>&gt;<i> the C++ standard afaik).
</I>
The configuration is not based on that fact. It tests whether this holds, in 
which case the constants can be computed the way I did. Otherwise, they have 
to be computed the way you did in arith-conf.cc, which will be automatically 
done by make. I would be very surprised if these constants were really 
guaranteed by the C++ standard, I couldn't find anything like that on the web 
or in &quot;The C++ programming language&quot;.

The problem with computing the constants at &quot;configure&quot; time the way you did 
in arith-conf.cc is if you try to cross-compile, as you have to run the 
generated executable... That is why I tried to get around this if the 
platform supports it.

&gt;<i> Then please:
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> NO C STYLE CASTS, NOWHERE. READ AND UNDERSTAND CASTS IN C++ (Denys will

</I>
Ok, we'll go through the code and get rid of them.

&gt;<i> NO FUNKY LAYOUT! Fact is, do it as I did it (I know that's tough luck, but
</I>&gt;<i> such is life).
</I>
What layout are you referring to? Directory structure or coding conventions? 
I'm sure we'll have to work on both...

Guido
