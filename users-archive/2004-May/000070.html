<PRE>There are two more things to be taken into account for posting.

The first is that one needs to make sure that a propagator is never posted
in a failed space (as there is not guarantee that the datastructures in a
failed space obey the invariants). Therefore a post-function first needs to
check whether the space is failed or not. You might want to use the macro
GECODE_CFAILED() for that (see kernel/macros.hh).

The second issue has to with the two different array types: ArgsArray&lt;...&gt;
and VarArray&lt;...&gt; (such as SetVarArgs and VarArray&lt;SetVar&gt;). The former is
reserved for passing arrays to post-functions, and that ONLY by const&amp; (that
is the type must be const SetVarArgs&amp;). The latter are the arrays with which
propagators compute. The propagator post function is the only function which
takes the type VarArray&lt;SetVar&gt;. The constructors always take
VarArray&lt;SetVar&gt;&amp;. Why: when passing a ArgsArray to something that expects a
VarArray a copy of the array is created (coercion). This of course should
only happen when it is really needed and this is in the post-function. If it
were to happen in the static propagator post method, each time you would
invoke that you would do that copy!

I know changed the propagator abstractions to follow that rule which broke
the set stuff. If you want to look for an example check out the distinct or
bool stuff: This is also interesting to see where to do inlinining and where
not.
