<PRE>Dear all,

one part of Gecode which has been just a mock-up for long is how
dependencies are maintained. So far all dependencies have been stored
contigously in one big array (leading to very low memory overhead due to
unsued entries in the arrays). However, the big disadvantage of this is that
in order to find all propagators for a certain propgation condition requires
scanning _all_ dependencies.

I added a new implementation (define DEPENDENCIES_BY_PROPCOND to enable)
which still stores all dependencies in one big array, however manintains a
partition according to propagation condition. This is achieved by
maintaining index information yielding the start of the different classes in
the partition (quite tricky but very efficient). 

Pros/Cons:
 - Requires a little more memory (six words per variable)
 - Subscribing becomes slower (but still constant time)
 - Releasing becomes faster (as now only the class in the partition with the
right propagation condition needs to be considered). Remember: releasing is
executed much more often than subscribing (cloning!).
 - Copying should stay about the same.
 - Amazingly to me, there is a great opportunity to improve one of the core
loops (process for Boards). This has a big impact!
 - Adds one more size restriction: propagation conditions are to be less
than PC_GEN_MAX (less than 5 for now). PC_GEN_MAX actually defines the size
of the index data structure. If this is not good enough, there is no
problem: for all but copying it easily possible to pass this information,
and for copying one could delegate copying of dependency information to the
VarModBoards (as done for proessing already).

The reason I did it is actually for set vars, where this should buy much
more than for int vars. Unfortunately, this does currently not compile...
Please check out what difference in efficiency you can observe (I hacked the
SetVarModBoard::process() function but you have to check it).

For intvars, everything is faster typically in the range of 3 to 8 percent.
One example is very interesting though: here one gets a 40% speed-up. This
is for the &quot;trashing&quot; benchmark where the only thing that is basically
measured is how fast the system can process events and schedule propagators.

A warning: as of course the order of how propagators are invoked is changed
by this, you can even sometimes note a slowdown as the different execution
order could require some more steps until reaching a fixpoint.

Please let me know
Christian
