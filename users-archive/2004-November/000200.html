<PRE>Dear all,

I added regular as another new global constraint which constrains
the sequence of values of a variable array to be a member of some
regular language.

The constraint is posted by

	regular(home, x, dfa)

where home is the home-space, x is an array of integer variables,
and dfa is a deterministic finite automaton describing the
regular language of interest (see below).

The propagator is domain-consistent, takes per invocation O(nt)
time in the worst-case, where n is the number of variables and t
is the number of transitions of the underlying DFA. The algorithm
is incremental with respect to the changed variables (only the
minimal number of variables is considered per invocation). So in
average, it should be more like O(t) (and also typically only a
fraction of the transitions is considered).

The algorithm is based on the very interesting paper:
 *   Gilles Pesant, A Regular Language Membership Constraint
 *   for Finite Sequences of Variables, CP 2004. 
 *   Pages 482-495, LNCS 3258, Springer-Verlag, 2004.

However, the algorithm I implemented is much simpler but less
incremental (due to how variables are implemented, one would only
gain from Pesant's version only if value removal were constant
time!).

DFA by transitions
------------------

A dfa can be specified by creating an instance of DFA, as an
example consider a dfa which allows alternating sequences of 0
and 1 with equal number of 0s and 1s:

Transitions are specified by giving triples (of type
DFA::Transition) of i_state (states are non-negative integers),
symbol (normal integers describing values), and o_state:

	i_state	| symbol | o_state
	--------------------------
	  0	|  0     |  1
	  0   |  1     |  2
        1   |  1     |  0
        2   |  0     |  0

(basically, the (partial) transition function d is defined by
	d(i_state,symbol) = o_state
)

In C++:

DFA::Transition t[] = {
  {0,0,1}, {0,1,2}, {1,1,0}, {2,0,0}, {-1,0,0}
};

The {-1,0,0} terminates the transition specification.

The single final state is 0, which can be described by

int f[] = {0,-1};

Again, -1 is used as endmarker.

Then the dfa can be created as

DFA a(0,t,f); // 0 is start state

By default, the dfa is minimized and unreachable states are
eliminated (minimization can be supressed by giving false as
additional argument).

DFA by regular expressions
--------------------------

A dfa can also be described by a regular expression where the
symbols are values and the operators are | for choice, + for
concatenation and prefix * for Kleene-star. Additionally, support
for repitition is provided (see below).

A regexp r for the empty string is created by
	REG r;

A regexp r for the integer i is created by
	REG r(i);

If r1 and r2 are REGs, then also (with normal C++ precedence)
	r1+r2, r1|r2, *r1
and
	r1(n,m)
		(repeat r1 at least n- and at most m-times)
and
	r1(n)
		(repeat r1 at least n-times)

By DFA a(r) a dfa a is created for the REG r.

Both dfa creation and conversion from a regexp to a dfa is not
hyper-efficient but also not completely dumb. Regexp to dfa is of
course exponential in the number of symbols in the worst case (subset
construction) and
minimization is cubic in the number of states (that is far from
being optimal...). Typically, even in nasty cases they work fast even on
automata
up to thousands of states. But that doesn't really matter as DFA
construction is only done once and dfa's can be reused for many
propagators.

Have fun!
Christian

PS: The constraint is useful for rostering problems, where
typically a specialized version called stretch is used. I still
fiddle with this one...

PPS: Sometimes memory management for DFA segfaults under Windows,
even though everything works fine on Linux (even valgrind likes
it). Have to look.
