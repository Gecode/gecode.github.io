Hmmm, this bug only appears with gcc, works fine with msvc. I will have a
look at valgrind myself. However, I will have time for that only next week.

Hi there, 
Sorry for that discussion about the ConLevel arguments. I just reinserted
them again and post the Bound Consistent Version.
 
Does anybody has a hint for me about the Distinct-prop and its
Bound-consistent version???
As soon as i'm using explicitly distinct("current space", "current vars",
CL_BND) or
even the Distinct::Bnd<Var>::post("space","vars") i'm always getting a
segmentation fault for
 

VALGRIND:
 
Invalid write of size 4 --> in function
Distinct::Bnd<IntVar>::propagate(Space*)
 
Is it the wrong way of using it?
 
Thx so far

Don't bother you any longer with that... Gabor already fixed it, it was
a compiler dependent bug with the AUTOARRAY macro definition 
concerning a call like AUTOARRAY(int, xyz, 2*n+2)
without parenthesis. 
So everything works out fine now. 
Thx nevertheless :-D

Subject: [Gecode] Flushing propagator resources
Message-ID: <004d01c4b6b6$3024fcd0$acd4ed82@beule>

Dear all,

sometimes it can be necessary to flush resources used by propagators (such
as memory used for data structures achieving incremental propagation). A
typical secanrio is to store a space for backtracking after propagation has
been performed on it (happens now and then but not in depth-first search).

To achieve this, a propagator can implement a virtual void flush(void)
member function and spaces also have the corresponding function: the
function is invoked on all propagators registered for explicit deletion (as
these are the propagators using explicit resources).

In case you use propagators with resources please also implement an
appropriate flush member function.

Cheers
Christian

Subject: [Gecode] Sharing between original and clones
Message-ID: <006601c4b766$83672a20$acd4ed82@beule>

Dear all,

as you might recall a recent observion is that Gecode is by construction
ready for concurrent and parallel search: no state is changed between spaces
created by cloning. No sharing means that no means for synchronization have
to be taken and that all complexity for concurrency control can be safely
delagted to the search engine.

However, this is not as clear as it seems... Consider as an example a
reference counted data structure (such as a domain specification shared
among clones of a propagator etc): reference counting requires concurrency
control (as is well known). Many other examples of course exist: shared
resources where sharing involves some form of management.

Therefore I extended copying of spaces by an additional bool argument that
tells whether resources are to be shared or not. That means that clone()
takes an optional boolean argument. If it is true things work as before, if
it is false (for example when a space is to be created to be executed in
adifferent thread) a true copy is attempted resolving sharing.

What I didn't due so far is to adapt domain specifications. It will follow
shortly. Please reconsider also the propagators you did whether sharing
needs to be taken into account. For an example look to the regular
propagator which shares DFAs.

Hi everyone!

Another iteration in our quest for a homepage and a logo:
http://www.gecode.org/Internal/home/index.html

(login "gecode", pwd "pr.p.g.t.", as usual)

My opinion:
I like Christian's short logo. I don't think we need a logo with the name 
"Gecode" in it, and I share Christian Schulte's opinion that "Gecode" in 
green is not such a good choice. The logo doesn't look too good without the 
"G". So, after all, I vote for keeping this version - maybe we can play 
around a bit with the font, size, and position of the "G".
The text on the front page is of course just a first rough cut.

I would really like to replace the current "homepage" at www.gecode.org with 
something that looks better and tells at least a little more - we advertised 
Gecode on the CP and MOZ conferences, so I guess there might be some people 
googleing for it, and the current homepage basically says "go away" ;-).
I hope we can find a compromise soon, so please tell me what you think about 
it.

I think the home page has a really attractive touch. The quite colorful 
logo is contrasted with the quite but not boring design of the page. I 
especially like the how the green bar on the side and the green links 
correspond to the green in the logo. This makes clear that green is the 
important part of Gecode without having to use green again for "gecode" 
as part of the logo.

Fine as it comes to the logo. Thanks so much to Christian!

Fine as it comes to the layout of the homepage. However I do insist that I
write the intro blurb... So far this is not really conveying the important
points. Also the structure of the people behind it needs to change: it ought
to be clear that I am leading the attempt and this needs to be said.

What I dislike about the blurb is that it makes way to strong claims and
does not stress the tru goal: the academic pursuit of knowledge! It's a
little bit more Zen like that: the way counts more than the goal here!

If you put the pages so far to the CVS we can get moving.

If you really need to show that things are happening you can bring up the
webpage without the text on the frontpage.

Very nice,

I have a couple of comments.

1. Please do not set the font-size.  Too many sites do this and it is
   very bad design.  The user sets his default font size to suit the
   resolution of his display, his eyesight, and more generally his
   personal preference.  In as much as possible you should respect
   that choice.

2. I advise against the "Groups" form of presentation.  We went that
   way with Mozart and we are very sorry.  Instead, have a section
   that says "Development" or something like that, and present
   developers individually instead of by institutions.

   A "Development" section also allows you to host development related
   information, such as CVS location, WebCVS interface, doxygen API
   docs, how to contribute.

you also need to mention the mailing list and the bug database (is
there one?)

Cheers,

Hi Guido,

Thanks for making the changes - the pages are now very readable on my
1600x1200 laptop screen.  Concerning "Development" section: I suggest
again that institutions should be deemphacized.  This software is
being developed by individuals, not institutions.  When we write
papers, authors are individuals: if necessary we add a footnote saying
"this research was supported by grant so-and-so".  Also, it is
possible that in the future you might want to attract external
contributors: an emphasis on institutions makes that more difficult.
Of course, Christian should decide, but this is merely my opinion.

Concerning the license: I have several remarks.

1. it should be more prominently accessible.  Currently, it's just the
   disclaimer at the bottom of the web page.

2. this license is refered to as the "Gecode License Agreement".
   That's an unknown.  Nobody has ever heard of it.  If at all
   possible it should be (1) either exactly an existing and reasonably
   well-known license, (2) or it should state and explain its lineage
   explicitly.  People have become (and rightfully so) paranoid about
   IP and licenses.  It is important to address their concerns up
   front:

   - what is this license?
   - is it compatible with e.g. the GPL?
   - is it possible to obtain other licensing conditions, e.g. for
     commercial applications?

I strongly disagree.  PS Lab is paying (in part) 
for Gecode and is supporting Gecode by a number 
of means.  Why should PS Lab do this if PS Lab 
has nothing to do with Gecode?

Oz/Mozart wouldn't exist if it was not supported by
DFKI and Saarland University.  You cannot create
anything of this magnitude in the open air.  Who do
you think paid and supported you during 6 years you 
were in Saarbr?cken and worked on Mozart?  God?
Why should anyone do this if this  is Denys and
just Denys and only Denys somewhere in Duchier 
land?  Even now, after more than 1 year, you are
still using the computer ressources of PS Lab.
Don't bite the hand that feeds you.

Obviously, the right balance needs to be maintained 
between institutions and individuals.  There are 
established means for doing this.  On Papers you 
see persons and their affiliation, for instance.
It seems, you are fighting this balance.

By the way, Oz/Mozart has been doing very well as long
as it was supported by strong institutions.  I very
much hope it will survive now that the mother institutions  
are reducing their commitment.  Having strong institutions
supporting a cause is an advantage, not a drawback.

Best,
Gert

It is also accessible from the "download" pages and should probably be put on 
the "documentation" pages as well.

We basically copied and adapted the Mozart license. So (according to the 
Mozart pages) it is "X11 style". Of course, we could make it even more "X11 
style" if we just copied the X11 license 
(http://www.x.org/Downloads_terms.html). The only obvious difference that I 
see is that it does not talk explicitly about sublicensing. The alternative 
here would be the MIT license (http://www.wordiq.com/definition/MIT_License) 
which is pretty much the same but includes sublicensing.

I don't know how important sublicensing is, I couldn't even really find a 
definition of what it actually means. If we want to go for a standard 
license, I think X11 is "free enough" - it allows commercial use and contains 
a disclaimer of all warranties. Of course this would mean that all authors 
and contributors agree (see the previous postings on this list about licence 
issues).

Actually, I just tried to find Mozart in the Free Software Directory because 
the Mozart web site says it's in there, but it's not. Maybe we should really 
consider a different license ;-)

Dear Denys,

just to clarify: Guido just did a quick brush up, in no means this is the
information with which we will go online. I will also deemphasize groups
(Denys knows that I will never ever again subscribe to a group-based model
of development). Also the license is not that big an issue as you say as it
is BSD style, as liberal as possible. But giving answers to common questions
is a good idea.

Further issues we will resolve:
 - There will be an Overview set of pages conveying the really important
points and the philosophy behind 
   the entire endeavour.
 - It will make a strong point on being open to contributors. The current
group section will be listing main
   designers, contributors, and give additional acknowledgments to people.
As Denys rightly says the model
   to follow is the academic model of acknowledgment used in papers, etc.
 - It will deemphasize C++. That's just the implementation language. It will
make the point that it is designed
   for interfacing and not modelling. It will make a point of a clean,
portable, open, minimal design
   from first principles stressing it also as a platform for academic
development.
 - It will make clear what our goals are: in general and where the future
will take us.

All these points have been discussed while Guido was staying here over
summer, so we have that all worked out.

If time allows, I will try to work most things out over the weekend.

In general, it is fine to start with little information but not with
misleading information.

Dear Gert,

partly I agree with what Denys says but I would like to use the normal
academic model: individuals with affiliations and their roles in the
development. In short this means that I'd like to put the individuals first
and then the institutions. I have no intention whatsoever to hide the
involvement of institutions.

But what I do not want is something such as a consortium. I feel it to be
unneeded and I object to the model in general due the Mozart experience.

Fine.  This I think is the best way to
handle it, and the standard one anyway.
The default interpretation is that the
institutions of the developers support
the development, in particular through
the persons listed as developpers.

I agree.  The problem with the consortium 
is that it is closed, more or less.  This
is in conflict with Gecode's goals.

To make my point clear: I insist that the
institutions supporting the developpers
can say that they develop Gecode.
