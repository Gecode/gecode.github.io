I strongly disagree.  PS Lab is paying (in part) 
for Gecode and is supporting Gecode by a number 
of means.  Why should PS Lab do this if PS Lab 
has nothing to do with Gecode?

Oz/Mozart wouldn't exist if it was not supported by
DFKI and Saarland University.  You cannot create
anything of this magnitude in the open air.  Who do
you think paid and supported you during 6 years you 
were in Saarbr&#252;cken and worked on Mozart?  God?
Why should anyone do this if this  is Denys and
just Denys and only Denys somewhere in Duchier 
land?  Even now, after more than 1 year, you are
still using the computer ressources of PS Lab.
Don't bite the hand that feeds you.

Obviously, the right balance needs to be maintained 
between institutions and individuals.  There are 
established means for doing this.  On Papers you 
see persons and their affiliation, for instance.
It seems, you are fighting this balance.

By the way, Oz/Mozart has been doing very well as long
as it was supported by strong institutions.  I very
much hope it will survive now that the mother institutions  
are reducing their commitment.  Having strong institutions
supporting a cause is an advantage, not a drawback.

Best,
Gert
