Ok, good.

It is also accessible from the &quot;download&quot; pages and should probably be put on 
the &quot;documentation&quot; pages as well.

We basically copied and adapted the Mozart license. So (according to the 
Mozart pages) it is &quot;X11 style&quot;. Of course, we could make it even more &quot;X11 
style&quot; if we just copied the X11 license 
(<A HREF="http://www.x.org/Downloads_terms.html">http://www.x.org/Downloads_terms.html</A>). The only obvious difference that I 
see is that it does not talk explicitly about sublicensing. The alternative 
here would be the MIT license (<A HREF="http://www.wordiq.com/definition/MIT_License">http://www.wordiq.com/definition/MIT_License</A>) 
which is pretty much the same but includes sublicensing.

I don't know how important sublicensing is, I couldn't even really find a 
definition of what it actually means. If we want to go for a standard 
license, I think X11 is &quot;free enough&quot; - it allows commercial use and contains 
a disclaimer of all warranties. Of course this would mean that all authors 
and contributors agree (see the previous postings on this list about licence 
issues).

Actually, I just tried to find Mozart in the Free Software Directory because 
the Mozart web site says it's in there, but it's not. Maybe we should really 
consider a different license ;-)
