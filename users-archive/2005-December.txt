Subject: [gecode-users] Relase 1.0.0 is approaching...
Message-ID: <000001c5f72b$7440def0$acd4ed82@beule>

Dear all,

after our bug fixing orgy is over, it is time to get Gecode out to the
masses! The steps to be taken are the following:
 - no more checkins! Patrick: please let us know when you are done. You have
to reach a stable state today.
 - a last run of tests! If there are problems they will be mentioned in the
docs but no more fixing unless
   we discover a general show stopper.
 - tag the release
 - pack the software and update the webpages

A question: should we also offer a binary package for windows? I think so,
so that this Gecode can be used with Visual Studio's IDE even though it
cannot be compiled yet.

After that, the next steps are (to be taken asap):
 - provide a webpage on the future and that we solicit contributions
 - provide a webpage with benchmarks!!!!!!!!!!!
 - cook up a way how we manage our changelog (I am leaning to an
automatically generated changelog with
   predefined criterias to describe a change based on some simple input
file)
 - cook up a way how to give pointers to contributions build on top of
Gecode

Anything else?
Christian

Hi.

After some reading about how to tag/branch the repository for the release, I 
would suggest to slightly change the directory structure of our repository. 
Currently, we have <root>/trunk/gecode, and <root>/tags and <root>/branches. 
In addition, we have all the other directories (like www, doc, interfaces) 
inside the trunk. I would suggest to move all trunk directories to the 
toplevel, and move their contents to separate trunk directories. For the main 
source, this would mean
<root>/gecode/trunk, <root>/gecode/tags, and <root>/gecode/branches as the 
respective dirs.
Advantages: easier access control, better separation.

If you don't object, I will do the necessary changes.

Cheers,
	Guido

It's available in contribs/graph/INSTALL (mixed with how to compile 
cp(graph))

We are going to make a release branch today.
I'll tell Guido where it is located as soon as our administrator makes 
it public (probably on monday morning).
We have set up  a contrib webpage:
http://cpgraph.info.ucl.ac.be/
You asked to provide an html file with a short description of the 
contribution. Is that text OK ?
 
Best,

Yes, that will do. Please have a look at the webpages: we have just done the
release and also have put a pointer on the first page to your stuff (Guido
is currently still reshuffling the pages a little bit here and there).
Please check with Yves whether this is okay or whether he wants something
more...

All the best
Christian

Hi,

As the bug interface only permits posting for 0.9.0 and unspecified, I
just wanted to post a short note.

I think the webpage should read "has been released on December 6th,
2005" instead of "2006". I hope i did not cost you THAT much time  ;-) .

Cheers and all the best

Patrick
