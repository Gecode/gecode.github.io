Subject: [Gecode] Java interface
Message-ID: <FEFB9B92-619F-11D9-B5FA-001124308F04@ps.uni-sb.de>

Hi everyone!

I have just checked in a Java interface for Gecode. It uses SWIG 
(http://www.swig.org) to automatically generate everything from a 
relatively simple interface file.

Things that still need to be done:
* It must be thread safe. Java creates "real" threads for executing 
native methods, so we either have to make the methods thread safe or 
synchronize them globally. At the moment, threads seam to make it crash 
:-(
* Set constraints are missing (but easy to add).
* At the moment, only the DFS search engine is available from Java. I 
will soon add Branch and Bound - especially interesting because JNI 
makes it easy to write callback functions in Java. This is really cool 
;-)
* The low-level representation of variables is the same as in Alice: 
they're integer indices into an array of real Gecode variables. At the 
moment, it is not checked whether a certain variable is valid in a 
Space. I will either add checks or come up with a different scheme.
* Lift all kinds of exceptions from C++ to Java.
* Test it with Windows (as soon as I get my Sony notebook back...)
* Do some benchmarks - there is probably some overhead in the 
interface, but to me it seems to be reasonably low.
* Implement the Java explorer ;-)

To summarize: SWIG seems to be well suited for this task - it took me 
just two days from learning the very basic things about SWIG to having 
a rather complete interface. I hope it will be just as easy to create 
O'Caml and Python interfaces.

Cheers,

	Guido

Hi.

First of all, I think we should move the discussion to our mailing 
list. Please subscribe to it via the web interface:

That looks ok.

That should be everything you need to change in the kernel. The 
VarTypeId is used by the kernel to delegate all domain dependent 
actions to the correct variable implementation.

Subject: [Gecode] IntVarProcessor question.
Message-ID: <20050120163610.M94031@atlas.puj.edu.co>


Hi all,


I am trying to set up a constraint system over real numbers in gecode.  I need
to implement a method like IntVarProcessor::process but according with the
events of the new constraint system. Unfortunately i don't understand what is
this method intended for. This method is closely related to
Space::process_modified which takes the variable, two propagation conditions
and a modification event as arguments, but a relationship between the event
which caused variable modification and the two propagation conditions is not
much clear to me.  

Would it be possible for any of you to provide a short description of this?.
In the following i list the propagation events declared for the new system:

ME_RI_VAL -> when a variable gets instantiated.
ME_RI_BND -> both, lower and upper bounds where modified.
ME_RI_MIN -> the lower bound was modified.
ME_RI_MAX -> the upper bound was modified.

I have also defined the corresponding PC_RI_* propagation conditions!.

Thanks in advance.

Gustavo Gutierrez

Hi.

The VarProcessors are responsible for translating from Modification 
Events (MEs) to Propagation Conditions (PCs) and putting all 
propagators registered for certain PCs into the propagation queue.
The Processor iterates over all variables of its VarTypeID and, 
depending on a variable's ME, all propagators that are registered for 
the corresponding PC are "processed". The propagators are organized in 
an array that is sorted by the PCs they respond to. So for example, if 
you have ME_INT_MAX, all propagators registered for PC_INT_BND, 
PC_INT_MAX, and PC_INT_DOM have to be processed. The order of PCs for 
Int is VAL, BND, MIN, MAX, DOM. process_modified takes two PCs as its 
arguments. These are used as pointers into the propagator array: 
process_modified(x,PC_INT_MAX,PC_INT_DOM,ME_INT_MAX) means to process 
all propagators "between" DOM and MAX (incl.).
So basically, for implementing process, you just have to know the order 
of your PCs and which MEs should trigger which PCs. The rest can be 
copied from the IntVarProcessor.
