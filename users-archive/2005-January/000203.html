<PRE>Hi everyone!

I have just checked in a Java interface for Gecode. It uses SWIG 
(<A HREF="http://www.swig.org">http://www.swig.org</A>) to automatically generate everything from a 
relatively simple interface file.

Things that still need to be done:
* It must be thread safe. Java creates &quot;real&quot; threads for executing 
native methods, so we either have to make the methods thread safe or 
synchronize them globally. At the moment, threads seam to make it crash 
:<i>-(
</I>* Set constraints are missing (but easy to add).
* At the moment, only the DFS search engine is available from Java. I 
will soon add Branch and Bound - especially interesting because JNI 
makes it easy to write callback functions in Java. This is really cool 
;-)
* The low-level representation of variables is the same as in Alice: 
they're integer indices into an array of real Gecode variables. At the 
moment, it is not checked whether a certain variable is valid in a 
Space. I will either add checks or come up with a different scheme.
* Lift all kinds of exceptions from C++ to Java.
* Test it with Windows (as soon as I get my Sony notebook back...)
* Do some benchmarks - there is probably some overhead in the 
interface, but to me it seems to be reasonably low.
* Implement the Java explorer ;-)

To summarize: SWIG seems to be well suited for this task - it took me 
just two days from learning the very basic things about SWIG to having 
a rather complete interface. I hope it will be just as easy to create 
O'Caml and Python interfaces.

Cheers,

	Guido
