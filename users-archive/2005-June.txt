I moved set/views.hh and set/views to set/view.hh and set/view to be 
consistent with the int naming scheme. As I moved them directly in the CVS

Hi,

there will be no anonymous access before the release. However, I can put up
now and then an updated archive under

But currently we are in the process of getting the structure right for the
release, so I will put this up only a little later (beginning of next week).

Subject: [Gecode] Some observations on views depending on more than one
	variable
Message-ID: <42841.130.237.15.12.1117722053.squirrel@webmail.sys.kth.se>

Hi,

There are some interesting problems associated with views of more than
one variable that I discovered when investigating the possibility of having
a view that represents the sum of two variables.

In the following, assume that we have two identity-views V1 and V2 (on
variables v1 and v2), and the sum-view S representing V1+V2. Let the
initial state be represented by (v1,v2)=({0..2},{0..2}).

The simple definition of the operations min and max for S are:
	max() := V1.max() + V2.max()
	min() := V1.min() + V2.min()
Now we have a problem, because telling something will not necessarily
affect subsequent min- and max-operations on S. For example, telling
"S < 3" does not imply anything for the V1 or V2. Thus we may have
that after telling "S < 3", S.max() may still return 4. This will
break some very basic assumptions made on views, and therefore we need
something stronger if sum-views are going to work.

One possible idea is to add state to the sum-view, recording the
requested minimum and maximum. This will not work either. Consider the
initial state again. Min and max for S will initially return 0 and 4
respectively. Now we tell "S < 4", making the requested upper bound
for S equal to 3. This can not affect V1 or V2, although we 'know'
that (v1,v2)!=({2},{2}). Now let V1 and V2 both be assigned 2. We are
now in an inconsistent state, that in the Gecode framework will not be
detected until we do a tell on S, which may be to late.

To 'fix' this problem, it is necessary to add all the features of a
real variable representing the sum, and then we may as well use the
explicit variable instead.


Regards,
Mikael Lagerkvist

Hi,

unfortunately you do not mention which platform you are running the programs
on, but I guess it might be Windows you are referring to. If you build under
Windows the macro HAVE_WIN_SDK must be defined to get timing on.

So when using MSVC, just using
	make -f Makefile.mvc
will do the job.

When using the autoconf stuff
	make CUSR=-DHAVE_WIN_SDK
should do the trick (is that true?)

The changed behaviour is due to the fact that I switched to the free version
of the MSVC compiler and in order to do timing with that one has to first
install the Windows Platform SDK, which I just did over the weekend.

Cheers
Christian

Subject: [Gecode] Re: Problem with operator== for views,
	equality vs. aliasing.
Message-ID: <007901c56b5e$9f3dc310$acd4ed82@beule>

Dear all,

I now have provided some working infrastructure for testing sharing and
equality.

A view x depends on a variable v, either if x is an identify view for v or x
is derived from a view v' which depends on v (this assumes the terminology
in the views paper).

Two views x and y (of not necessarily the same type) _share_ a variable v,
if both x and y depend on v. The views are also called shared. Written in
Gecode as x & y.

Two views x and y of the same type are _equal_, if they are identical. This
means that when becoming assigned they will have the same value. Written in
Gecode as x == y (also != is available).

Additionally, there is an ordering on views. The order is completely
arbitrary (implemented for example by location in memory) and is not stable
with respect to cloning. However, the following important invariant holds:
if x<y and x and y are shared, then for a view z that is not shared with x
or y: z < x or y < z but never x < z < y. For example, the implementation
achieves this by using lexicographic ordering where the variable component
of a derived view takes precedence.

This means that when sorting views of the same type wrt <, shared views are
next to each other.
 
ViewArrays now provide some functionality for sorting and finding shared or
equal views. For a ViewArray x:
	x.equal()	tests whether x has at least two equal views.
	x.shared()	tests whether x has at least two shared views.
	x.group_equal()	sorts the views in x and returns x.equal()
	x.group_shared()	sorts the views in x and returns x.shared()

All operations take n log n in average (based on quicksorting the views). If
the order of views in a ViewArray does not matter, the group_-variants are
more efficient (in-place sorting).

However, the original problem we wanted to tackle with all this, is still
unsolved: how to decide idempotence with shared views... See next Email.

Subject: [Gecode] Interaction between shared variables and idempotency
Message-ID: <007e01c56b6d$53bd7660$acd4ed82@beule>

Dear all,

initially, the tests for sharing and equality on views was meant to address
issues with shared variables for idempotent propagators.

As a reminder, a propagator returns ES_FIX if it is at a fixpoint and
ES_NOFIX if it is not at a fixpoint. For efficiency, the propagator should
try hard to tell ES_FIX most of the times when it is actually at fixpoint.
However, this is difficult for propagators computing on shared views:
performing an operation on a view also narrows the domain of the shared
view.

Here are three strategies for finding out whether a propagator is at
fixpoint with shared views.

1. Suppose a propagator that only performs at most one write operation to a
view. Typical examples are "smart" propagators such as distinct, regular,
etc. They work by first computing new domain information for each view and
then writing or posting this information back to the views. Here one can use
a trick to find out whether one has computed a fixpoint or not: a view x
provides an operation x.modified(). When a propagator starts execution
modified() is false for all views. Only after a modification has taken
place, it becomes true. So the following works: before the propagator posts
to the view x, it checks whether x is already modified. If yes, the
propagator might not be at a fixpoint. Otherwise, it is.

2. The propagator computes in a loop until a fixpoint is reached. The
propagator must make sure that this loop really computes a fixpoint! For
example, when the loop is based until no view changes this also must
consider that no shared view has been changed. Here the trick with modified
is not available.

3. Check for sharing once and for all. If none of the above works, just
check whether the propagator has shared views or not. If it has, ALWAYS
report ES_NOFIX! This can be achieved most efficiently by making the
propagator generic with respect to whether to return ES_FIX and ES_NOFIX
through a template.

Here comes also an example why this matters. Assume domain consistent
distinct and variables x with domain {1,2} and y both with domain {2,3} and
the following three views v1 := x+0, v2 := x+1, v3 := y. Propagation should
yield x=1 and y=3 directly! However, if the propagator does not detect that
v1 and v2 are shared it will only propagate that x=1 and y in {2,3}!

And yes, sharing sucks. And yes, almost all propagators are faulty (but
linear and bool!)...

Hi everyone!

We will from now on (until we actually release) provide tarballs of the
Gecode CVS whenever we find that something substantial has changed and the
CVS is relatively stable. You can download them from our internal pages:
https://www.gecode.org/Internal

The login is gecode, the password pr.p.g.t. (that is propagate with a .
instead of each vowel). Note that these pages are from now on only
accessible via https - please ignore if your browser complains that the
certificate is not valid.

We have recently restructured some parts of the library, and we think what
we have now is pretty much what we are going to release (in terms of
structure). Comments and bug reports (and of course patches that fix the
bugs ;-) are highly welcome! On the internal pages, you will find a
bugzilla bug tracking system.

Please keep in mind that these are pre-release versions, and the same
restrictions apply as for the tarballs Christian has sent you: please do
not redistribute them.

Cheers,
   Guido

Subject: [Gecode] Memory information: needed? how accurate?
Message-ID: <001c01c57738$864f6030$acd4ed82@beule>

Dear all,

the last thing which is currently on the list of things to be done for
Gecode in order to release is functionality that allows to inquire how much
memory is used for solving a problem (of course, putting docs aside).

The simplest approach would be only to check how much memory has been
allocated by each space. However, propagators also can have memory allocated
for caching intermediate states and this can be quite substantial. Does one
also want to know about this?

Moreover, in order to find out how much memory is used by a search engine it
is not sufficient to only look out for how much memory is allocated for
spaces as also branch descriptions (used for batch recomputation) are stored
by the search engine. Does one want to know?

And even more: would one wish to have the possibility to ask for the peak
memory consumption of a search engine?

So many questions so little answers...

With this patch g++ 3.2.3 compiles gecode ok

G++ 3.4.4 works much faster then 

The patch should work with g++ 3.4.4 so it doesn't
harm to apply it. However I can't check it for MSVC.
If MSVC failed to accept the .template construct,
conditional compilation would help.
