Subject: [Gecode] bug: equal and the empty set
Message-ID: <4291F691.9090909@info.ucl.ac.be>

Hi,
Here is an example code for a bug I ran into : void equals(Space *, 
SetVar x, SetVar y)
segfaults  when y is instanciated to the empty set.

I also attach a patch against set/reified/propagators.cc 1.25
(this is a CVS version Christian sent me a few weeks ago - I have no CVS 
access).

All the best,

Should read twice before posting.
The previous patch does not fix it in other cases (two sets not equal 
but neither being empty).
This one should be better;

Thanks a lot! I've already added your fix to the CVS. I'm very interested
in feedback on the set propagators, as they are less well tested than the
integers. Also, requests for propagators that should be there but aren't
are very welcome ;-)

Subject: [Gecode] Problem with operator== for views, equality vs. aliasing.
Message-ID: <Pine.GSO.4.58.0505261119510.14159@my.nada.kth.se>

Hi,

I recently found that there is a problem with the equality-operators
for views in Gecode. The operators are defined to handle aliasing,
that is, the operation checks for usage of the same base variable.

However, the usage is (at least in some places), based on operator==
testing semantic equality.  As an example, take
Int::Rel::Le<View>::post(...) from int/rel/lq-le.icc, lines 95-103:

	template <class View>
	ExecStatus
	Le<View>::post(Space* home, View x0, View x1) {
	  if (x0 != x1) {
	    (void) new (home) Le<View>(home,x0,x1);
	    return ES_OK;
	  }
	  return ES_FAILED;
	}

Consider this when invoked using two scale-views representing 3*x and
5*x. Then the invocation will erroneously fail.


So, what should the equality-operator mean, and what do we call the
other operation?


Regards,
Mikael

Hi,

the code is of course complete rubbish as Mikael points out correctly. What
I never really understood is what "==" is supposed to mean. What I had in
mind is that it means aliasing: two views refer to the same variable. This
is of course important in many cases, however here clearly it means
"identical". So what we should do is the following:

x == y <=> the two views need to be of the same kind and are identical (same
var, same constants, etc)

x aliases y <=> the two views of whatever type depend on the same variable

Another relation on views is x < y: the variable associated with view x is
less (wrt to some order on variables) than the variable associated with y.

So what needs to be done:
 - replace "==" to mean identity 
 - introduce something for "aliases". How about "&" (along the lines that
two views have something in common). Or just "aliases" textually.

Hi,

I'm currently implementing Graph variables, constraints on these variables
and  new set propagators in Gecode as part of my PhD thesis on 
biochemical network analysis.

I am suffering a bit from the lack of developper documentation on gecode.
I'm currently doing it with trial and error and "reverse-engineering" of 
the source code.

Do you have a text describing the design choices that were made in gecode ?
If I remember well, some work on the documentation was planned around 
these months.
I am willing to contribute to the documentation project as I anyway have 
to understand how gecode works.

Is this mailing list the sole place to ask questions about gecode (the 
very low traffic scares me a bit ;-) ?

All the best,

Dear Gr?goire,

So far the is no text. We intend to write a text ove summer. However, please
find me puzzled: we warned you that Gecode is in the making, so all what you
observe is what we meant by "in the making".

It's ok, I knew there was no docs yet. I was just wondering if there was 
a draft.
I'll post my questions on the mailing list then.

Subject: [Gecode] Copy versus update...
Message-ID: <001201c565fa$b1759670$acd4ed82@beule>

Dear all,

one reason why Gecode did not compile with GCC 4.0 was that copying arrays
and variables was modelled by a function returning a copy. The problem was
that this required copy constructors which by themselves required copy
constructors which by themselves required copy constructors... This problem
was hacked up by some bizarre overloading which just happened to work for
MSVC and GCC 3.*.

I changed that: instead of c=x.copy(home) returning a copy c of an object x,
one has to use c.update(home,x). This avoids all the copy constructor
hassel. However, to make it work c now needs a default constructor.

And voila, now Gecode compiles with GCC 4.0. I just tried a couple of
examples and it appears as if the code is _really MUCH MUCH faster_ than
3.*.

Cheers
Christian

The toplevel header files to be included (gecode-*) are now available
