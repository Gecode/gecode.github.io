Subject: [Gecode] ViewTuple instead of ViewPair
Message-ID: <007701c5cdb0$0a869ee0$acd4ed82@beule>

Please,

could everybody using ViewPair<View> convert to ViewTuple<View,2>? Then
ViewPair can be removed. This is actually the last interface change before
the release (as far as I can see).

ViewPair is only used in sortedness. Maybe one now can use ViewTuple<View,3>
altogether there?

Subject: [Gecode] Space consumption of set variables
Message-ID: <200510111814.41145.tack@ps.uni-sb.de>

Hi all.

I've tried to improve the memory consumption of set variables a bit. The first 
thing was to implement doubly linked lists for the domains the way Christian 
did it for the integers, using just one pointer for both directions. This 
saves 1.6-4.4% (measured using the peak memory returned by the search 
engines).
My second try was to get rid of half of the modification events and 
propagation conditions, by making all bounds events imply a cardinality 
event. This saves quite a lot of memory, between 4% and 8.7%. My conclusion 
is that additional propagation conditions are expensive, and should only be 
used if a lot of propagators can really make use of the stronger information. 
This does not seem to be the case with cardinality PCs for set constraints.

Cheers,
	Guido

Hi all,

I know nothing is too expensive for the guy who just watches, and that 
this implies a horrible nightmare of a build process, with exponential 
number of scenarios to test and maintain, but I just have to say it:
Maybe these kind of alternative implementations could be factorised into 
build options of the library, so double-plus-expert users could tweak 
them to fit their problem domains?
It just seems like such a waste to permanently drop a setup which might 
benefit some (agreed, probably not many) propagators.

Hi Gabor,

Long time no hear!

While I tend to agree in spirit with Gabor, the good news is that getting
things back on stage is soooooo easy these days ;-) The interfaces have
become so simple, that's just a breazer (how do you spell that damn word?).
My decision for simplifiying the integer variables went along that way.

Cheers
Christian

Message-ID: <200510121134.46542.tack@ps.uni-sb.de>

Hi all.

We will move our repository to the subversion revision control system on 
Monday. That means that you should check in everything you are currently 
working on by Sunday, 12pm. I will announce the details on how to use the new 
svn repository on Monday.
Furthermore, please note that tomorrow we will be switching our servers here 
in Saarbr?cken. The gecode web site, the cvs and the mailing lists will not 
be available after 2pm for some time. Also, everyone will need to log out 
from the clients. We hope to get things up and running again as quickly as 
possible.

Cheers,

Hi all!

I have completed the migration to our brand new subversion repository. To
checkout from svn, simply use

svn checkout svn+ssh://svn.gecode.org/srv/gecode/svn/trunk/gecode

This should work for all users that were previously allowed to do cvs
checkouts. For the other modules (www, interfaces), simply replace the
last "gecode" with the corresponding module name.

Ah, right. Subversion handles deletion in a completely different way - the
Attic is included only as an artifact of the conversion. I think we should
just use svn to delete all the Attic directories (which of course remain in
an older version in the repository). Does that sound reasonable?

Dear all,

I encourage all of you to check the "class" page of the genereated
documentation for lacking documentation now and then. I think it is a good
idea to have at least a brief sentence about what each class does in
principle

Currently the following areas are still incompletely documented:

 int/cumulatives (just a minor omission)

 int/sortedness
 int/gcc

 set/branch (here the structure is still not the structure we agreed upon
for branching as it does not allow for reusing the variable/value selection
classes)

 set/* some small random omissions

 examples/* some few examples (recent additions still lack doc)

Message-ID: <200510200931.40015.tack@ps.uni-sb.de>

Hi.

The web pages are now checked out from svn instead of CVS. One problem I found 
was that the cvs2svn conversion tool I used didn't set the properties right 
for binary files that were not marked as binary in our CVS. That screwed the 
images in the www directory...
When checking in binary files, please make sure that subversion guesses their 
mime-type correctly. You can easily verify that using the svn proplist 
command, it should show at least an svn:mime-type property and neither 
svn:keywords nor svn:eol-style.

Dear all,

while I of course do not want to limit your creativity, my experience has
shown that the following things are quite useful:
 - when declaring a function or constructor etc without arguments, give void
as parameters
 - when using if, while, etc always leave a space between if and ( as in "if
(test)"
 - when calling or defining a function don't leave space

With these rules, calls can be easily distingusihed from definitions and
statements. This is very useful for using grep, sed, and so on.

No, this one does not exist. For the time being you can just use
reification. If you need it badly (that is, you need the stronger
propagation) I can just add it (no big deal).

Please use gcc 3.4 or gcc 4.0 or better. The problem is that the parser in
earlier versions is broken (does not conform to the C++ standard). I just
added this note to the documentation.

Although the documentation pages still mention gcc 3.3 as minimum requirement, 
this is not actually true any more. We rely on some things in the C++ 
standard that only gcc 4 (or probably the 3.4 versions) implements correctly. 
Therefore, we will most probably not support gcc 3.3 in our final release. I 
hope it's not too big a problem for you all to port your code.
