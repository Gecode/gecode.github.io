<PRE>Hi.

&gt;<i> I have some propagators subscribed to an intview. After calling
</I>&gt;<i> space::status method, I cancel subscription of these propagators before
</I>cloning my space. However, they are still copied during the space
cloning. Is there a way to completely remove them from the space, as
they have become useless ?

Usually, a propagator can remove itself by returning ES_SUBSUMED. You
don't even have to cancel your subscriptions in that case, that should be
done automatically by the propagator's destructor.

If you want to remove the propagator &quot;from the outside&quot; (i.e. not from
within its propagate member function), you must somehow signal that it
should return ES_SUBSUMED on the next run.

(they are not subscribed anymore to any
&gt;<i> view...) I tried to delete them right after cancelling subscription but,
</I>as I quite expected, this gives me a segmentation fault during cloning
of the space.

A propagator is under full control of the Gecode kernel. If you remove it
from outside, all the book-keeping datastructures in the kernel become
inconsistent. The only way to remove a propagator is via subsumption. This
is also the intended logical meaning: a space is monotonic in that only
more constraints can be added. A propagator can only be removed if it
cannot contribute any longer, i.e. if it is subsumed.

Cheers,
   Guido
