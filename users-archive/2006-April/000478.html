#361445 was reassigned to gcc-snapshot package already.  Looks like we
had a false alarm.

Gecode 1.0.1 has been stuck in the NEW queue for some time, I may get
to upload 1.1.0 before 1.0.1 arrives to Debian proper.

Gecode's build system is quite regular, I haven't had trouble with
working on it.  If only I'd find the opportunity to use gecode for
something myself, too.  ;-)

BTW, I have set the Debian package build script to run test/test.
That, too, is pending having gecode's new version arrive to Debian.
