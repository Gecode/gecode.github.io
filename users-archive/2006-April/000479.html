<PRE>Hi.

&gt;&gt;<i> I've had a look at the debian bug report. It really looks odd. The
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> compiler suggests to use -fPIC, although that's in fact switched on by
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> default. So, at the moment, I'd guess it's a problem in gcc 4.2 rather
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> than in Gecode.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> #361445 was reassigned to gcc-snapshot package already.  Looks like we
</I>&gt;<i> had a false alarm.
</I>
Good to know. And Patrick seems to have been successful with (another
snapshot of) gcc 4.2.

&gt;<i> Gecode 1.0.1 has been stuck in the NEW queue for some time, I may get
</I>&gt;<i> to upload 1.1.0 before 1.0.1 arrives to Debian proper.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Gecode's build system is quite regular, I haven't had trouble with
</I>&gt;<i> working on it.  If only I'd find the opportunity to use gecode for
</I>&gt;<i> something myself, too.  ;-)
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> BTW, I have set the Debian package build script to run test/test.
</I>&gt;<i> That, too, is pending having gecode's new version arrive to Debian.
</I>
Is there a time limit for builds in Debian? By now, testing takes a long,
long time - I'm afraid users building gecode from source may have too
little patience.

Mikael, Christian, perhaps we should put together a set of tests that
check some basic functionality and that complete within 5 minutes or so,
and only do the complete tests ourselves before we release.

Cheers,
   Guido
