I've finally decided to use gecode instead of gecode/J so that I could
modify the existing classes dfs.icc, reco-stack.icc and search.hh rather
than implement the whole from nothing.

I've managed to get the way to the solution found, that is the list of
alternatives to follow. But I don't really understand how to rebuild the
stack.

In my opinion, I have to push a new ReCoNode in the stack for each
alternative.

I've tried to add a method in DFSEngine that rebuild the stack:

	// Reconstruct the stack from the way (ex: way = &quot;0110111&quot;)
	forceinline void
	DfsEngine::setWay(string way){
		rcs.reset();
		const BranchingDesc* desc = rcs.push(cur, NULL);
		for(int i=0;i&lt;way.length();i++){
			//Get the integer in ith pos in the way
			string stmp = way.substr(i,1);
			const char* tmp = stmp.c_str();
			int j = atoi(&amp;tmp[0]);
			
			//push a new ReCoNode in the stack
			cur-&gt;commit(desc,j);
	     		desc = rcs.push(cur,NULL);
		}
	}

Once the stack is rebuild, I thought I could simply call the method
next().
But it doesn't seem to work...

I don't get any error, but the program simply stops when j = 1 but I
don't know why...

Has anybody any idea to help me ?

Thanks in advance

Mikael
