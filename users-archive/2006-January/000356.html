<PRE>Hello again,

I've completed the propagator implementation mentioned in my previous mails,
thank you for your help. To recall, the propagator, called 'tunneling',
relates three arrays of variables and upon propagation posts several new
constraints like equality, inequality and element restrictions.

With regard to the latter I've made some (for me) strange observations. What
my propagator does is basically check which of the variables in the arrays
have been fixed/assigned, posting a collection of the above mentioned
propagators for each of these variables respectively.

Now, if I keep track of the variables that have been 'treated' this way
(i.e. that had the respective collection of propagators posted on it) I can
make sure that this posting only happens once for each variable, thus
avoiding unnecessary redundancy (or so I think).

If, however, I do not keep track of this and just post the collection of new
propagators for each assigned variable (these propagators are always the
same for one variable) each time my tunneling propagator's propagate method
is called, I would expect identical search behaviour (maybe a little longer
running time due to duplicate propagators).

What happens, though, is quite the opposite: the latter version (potentially
posting the same propagators over and over again) yields a solution after a
few seconds. The first version, however, posting the propagators (at most)
once for each variable, ran for several minutes without finding a solution
until I aborted.

Here's a mixture of C++ and pseudo-code describing the stripped-down
critical part, assuming the three ViewArray&lt;intView&gt; instances are called x,
y, and z, all of length n:

propagate(Space* home) {
  for (int i=0; i&lt;n; ++i) {
    //... do stuff for x and y
    if (z[i].assigned() &amp;&amp; &lt;z[i] not yet treated&gt; ) {
      //... some preparations, like creating IdxView instances
      Element::ViewDom&lt;IntView,IntView&gt;::post(home,z,z.size(),x[i],z[i]);
      Element::ViewDom&lt;IntView,IntView&gt;::post(home,z,z.size(),y[i],z[i]);
    }
  }
  //...
}

[in the 'real' call of the post methods, z would have to be replaced by
IdxView instances]

A few words about the overall setting: I'm employing DFS search (DFS-copy,
to be exact) and apart from my tunneling propagator some other constraints
(e.g. distinct on several subsets of variables) are involved -- but those
are the same for both scenarios described above. The only difference is
really one line of code, enabling or disabling the above-mentioned
track-keeping mechanism (by removing the &lt;z[i] not yet treated&gt; part).

I've narrowed it down to the element constraints posted wrt. assigned
variables withing the 'tunneling' propagator (see the code above). Hence I
wonder: Why is there a difference between posting the same element
constraints once and posting them several times throughout the search
process? Is it possible to give a conceptual explanation for this, without
requiring more of the actual code?

Thank you very much in advance (once more),

/Lars Otten
