</I>&gt;<i> i ve got a global structure (accessible directly via my subclass of

</I>&gt;<i> also i dont think it is neccessary to rewrite the search engine,

</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> so i agree with guido: it is not global enough for a BAB and not local

</I>&gt;<i> but a new search engine? ;) i am not frightened about (i ve done it in

</I>&gt;<i> changes as small as possible!
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> hope this makes it clear
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> my current way:
</I>&gt;<i> - currently my MB::commit(..) returns ES_FAILED, if it detects the 
</I>&gt;<i> question for a new branching alternative and the last branchings have 
</I>&gt;<i> leaded to a special solution.
</I>&gt;<i> (i wrote it doesnt function but actually right now i found the bug in 
</I>&gt;<i> my code.. ;) now it works fine)
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> so the last open question is: any alternatives for skipping?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> the only one i see:
</I>&gt;<i> a) writing a new search engine that tests for skipping itself and 
</I>&gt;<i> removes the branching description directly
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> anything else?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> so thanks for your patience and support, and that you ve read until here!

</I>Dear Martin,

The basic problem I have with the description of your problem is that it 
is too attached to the implementation....If you describe your *problem* 
without referring to your implementation, that would certainly help me.
I thought that you simply wanted to impose conditional constraints 
(e.g., W&gt;2&amp;Y&gt;3 =&gt; X\=4 (because the solution you have involving X=4 
under  W&gt;2&amp;Y&gt;3 is already good enough)) each time you find a solution in 
order to discard branches that (from your expert point of view) may not 
lead to better solutions.
But I now I realize that I have completely missed the point...
Anyway, I have also enjoyed the discussion (and learned from it)!
Cheers,
Luis
