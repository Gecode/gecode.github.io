                             CP 2006
               Twelfth International Conference on
        Principles and Practice of Constraint Programming


                      September 24-29, 2006
                Cit&#233; des Congr&#232;s - Nantes, France

            <A HREF="http://www.sciences.univ-nantes.fr/cp06/">http://www.sciences.univ-nantes.fr/cp06/</A>


Description

The CP conference is the annual international conference on
constraint programming, and it is concerned with all aspects of
computing with constraints, including: algorithms, applications,
environments, languages, models, and systems. CP 2006 includes a
technical program, where presentations of theoretical and
application papers, as well as invited talks and tutorials, aim
at describing the best results and techniques in the
state-of-the-art of constraint programming. Moreover, CP 2006
continues the tradition of the CP doctoral program, in which PhD
students can present their work, listen to tutorials on career
and ethical issues, and discuss their work with senior
researchers via a mentoring scheme. There will also be a number
of workshops, where researchers will be able to meet in an
informal setting and discuss their most recent ideas with their
peers. 

Special events

CP 2006 will open on Sunday 24 September with CP-Tools-06, the
first event in a yearly series addressing CP systems design and
application development. During the conference, the 2006 ACP
award will be given and a plenary half day workshop will be
dedicated to the &quot;next ten years of Constraint Programming&quot;.

Conference site

CP 2006 will be held at the Nantes Cit&#233; des Congr&#232;s. Nantes is a
major center of the European West and the sixth largest town in
France. The city, which is located on the Loire Estuary and 50km
from the Atlantic coast, is famous for enjoying an exceptional
quality of life. Nantes is at the heart of a highly efficient
transportation network (high-speed trains from Paris, airport,
motorways, tramway). The Nantes Cit&#233; des Congr&#232;s is directly
accessible by shuttle from the airport, by bus from the city
center, and is within ten-minute walking distance from the city
center and the high-speed train station.

Registration and accommodation

We encourage you to register for the conference and make you
hotel reservations.  All relevant information can be found on the
conference's main web page,
