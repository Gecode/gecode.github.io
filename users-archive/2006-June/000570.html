<PRE>No, you always have to update views! If a propagator stores a view it must
be updated. In the situation you describe it will be that the variable
implementations to which the views stored in the space have already been
updated (that is, a copy has been created). However, also the views in the
propagators must be updated to point to the copied variable implementations.

In fact, this made me remember another question: suppose that in my 
program all the propagators are using the same views of the variables 
(i.e., there is only one view per variable) and theses views are updated 
in the constructor for cloning of the space. Is it correct to say that 
there is no need of updating these views in the constructor for cloning 
of the propagators (since these views are already updated in the 
constructor for cloning of the space)?
