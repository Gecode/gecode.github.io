<PRE>Me once more,

I am interested in the following scenario:

Given a CSP and a corresponding search tree (e.g. via DFS). During the 
enumeration of all solutions I test the solution. If it fullfills a 
certain criteria I would like to skip the alternatives of this solution 
due to the last branching (== A). Or (B): skip until a specific branching.

Think this is possible using the idea of the description stack of a 
search engine.

as a sketch in my mind it works like that:

(A) : just pop and skip the topmost BranchingDesc object from the 
description stack.

(B) : it would be neccessarry to identify the BranchingDesc objects 
(B.1) or to introduce a special tag that is placed on the stack (B.2)

(B.1) : if the BranchingDesc objects can be identified they are popped 
from stack until the searched one is reached. It's only neccessary to 
know the identifier for the description you want to jump to.

(B.2) : all are popped until the special tag description has been 
reached. but for that a special function to introduce the tags is 
neccessarry.

So my first question: is it possible? I had a closer look into the DFS 
implementation and thinking about to introduce the changes there, but I 
m not sure if it is really possible there.

Out of that my second question arises: what do you think about such a 
feature? Is it worth to become part of Gecode, or do you think I m the 
only one who would like to have it?

Or, is it already available and I m blind? ;)

Hope you arent bored ..

Martin
