Hm, actually it does not seem to be quite that simple. Memory consumption
for dfs-reco always seems to be lower, but wrt. running time things
sometimes get better, sometimes worse (compared to dfs-copy).

Is there any rule of thumb when to apply dfs-reco instead of dfs-copy?

Ok, so I think I understood the conceptual difference between ICL_DOM and
ICL_BND -- in consequence ICL_BND is 'less accurate' but potentially
propagates faster. But where does ICL_VAL fit into that? I am aware that
these levels are only meant to be guidelines for the propagators, still it
would be interesting to know...
