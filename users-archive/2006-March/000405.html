<PRE>Hello,

sorry, of course I meant preemptive schedule. Thank you for your answer ant
for the link to Le Pape's notes - I will read it too. I have now the Book
&quot;Constraint-based scheduling&quot; (Baptiste, Le Pape, Nuijten), where I found
lot of information about scheduling too.

But my problem is a little bit harder because moreover I need to assign
resource to the task from a given set of alternative resources (these sets
of resources must not be necessarily dijoint). It can be done by splitting
the tasks for each resource from the set of alternative resources and search
schedule with all these acitivities. Whenever the bounds of an splitted
activity turn out to be incoherent, the resource can be simply removed from
the set of possible alternative resources for the activity.

But for the propagating and branching I probably need to create my own
propagater and branch function (or not?). I would ask, if is there some
better documentation how to do this - because it is quite hard to do it only
with gecode documentation generated by doxygen.

Thank you very much

Best regards

Vladim&#237;r Du&#154;a

I believe you mean &quot;elastic cumulative schedule&quot; here, since
non-preemptive would mean that activities could not be interrupted.

</I>
The cumulative(s) constraint in Gecode models non-preemptive
scheduling problems, i.e., where the tasks can not be interrupted, and
the amount of resources used is constant for the whole duration of the
task. There is no specific constraint available in Gecode for elastic
or preemptive problems.

The cumulatives constraint is used in one example in Gecode,
examples/packing.cc, although it is not a good propagator for that
particular application.

If you want to read more about how to model different types of
scheduling-problems with constraint programming, I could recommend
Claude Le Pape's notes from the Summer Course in constraint
programming last year (available at
<A HREF="http://www.math.unipd.it/~frossi/cp-school/lepape.pdf">http://www.math.unipd.it/~frossi/cp-school/lepape.pdf</A>).

Hope this helps
Mikael
