The cumulatives constraint that is available allows one to specify
scheduling problems where the tasks may be allocated to different
machines (governed by the machine-parameter of the constraint). As
said previously though, this is only for non-preemptive problems.

My suggestion would be to first try to do some decomposition of the
problem into the available constraints, even if this leads to a very
inefficient model. This would give you something to compare against
for propagators that you implement yourself.

As for documentation, the doxygen-generated documentation is intended
as a reference, and not a tutorial. Writing some tutorial-like
documentation is definitely on our todo-list. There are two papers in
which important aspects of the Gecode architecture is discussed that I
can recommend, &quot;Views and Iterators for Generic Constraint
Implementations&quot; and &quot;Speeding Up Constraint Propagation&quot;, both
available from <A HREF="http://www.gecode.org/publications.html.">http://www.gecode.org/publications.html.</A> Apart from
that, I would recommend you to look at the implementation of some
propagator that you are familiar with, and see how it is done.

Hope this helps
Mikael
