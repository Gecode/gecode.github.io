<PRE>[sorry for multiple copies]

                        CP 2006
        Call for Applications to Doctoral Programme

Twelfth International Conference on Principles and Practice of
                Constraint Programming

                   September 25-29, 2006
                     Nantes, France

CP 2006 invites Ph.D. students to apply for the Doctoral Programme, a
forum held during the CP conference which provides an opportunity for
a group of Ph.D. students to achieve visibility and discuss their
research interests and career objectives with each other and
established researchers in Constraint Programming and its related
fields. After successful Doctoral Programmes in previous years, it is
being run again this year for the sixth time.

The aims of the Doctoral Programme are the following:

    - to provide a forum for Ph.D. students to present their current
research,
    and receive feedback from other students and senior researchers;
    - to promote contacts among Ph.D. students and senior researchers
working in the same area;
    - to exchange research experience;
    - to support Ph.D. students with information and advice on academic,
    research and industrial careers;
    - and to financially support its participants.

The programme will consist of students' presentations and/or posters,
and tutorials given by senior researchers in the field. In addition,
each student will be matched to a mentor who is a senior researcher
with similar research interests and who can advise the student on
his/her research progress.


Participation and Financial Support Rules
=========================================

    - Applicants will be selected to participate in the Doctoral Programme
based on the
    quality of their submissions;
    - participants who have never attended CP Doctoral Programmes will be
given higher
    priority for financial support;
    - participants who have already attended past CP Doctoral Programmes
will be given
    financial support if funding is available. In this case, priority is
given to students 
    who received less support from the DP in previous years.

Financial support consists in free conference registration and
accommodation. NOTE that only the students who applied and got
accepted for participation in the Doctoral Programme are subject to
financial support.


Paper Availability
==================

Student papers will be available during the conference and on the
Conference/Doctoral Programme websites.


Submissions
===========

We encourage submissions from Ph.D. students at any level, and from
any topic area and methodology within Constraint Programming and its
related fields. On the basis of the submissions, the Organizing
Committee will select a group of students that will be invited to
present their work during the Doctoral Programme, either as a
presentation or a poster. We expect a commitment from all
participating students to attend the entire Doctoral Programme.

Applicants should submit a paper electronically using the electronic
submission form at:

    <A HREF="http://www.softconf.com/start/CP_PHD06/submit.html">http://www.softconf.com/start/CP_PHD06/submit.html</A>

The paper should be a maximum of 6 pages in length and should follow
the usual LNCS style format at:

    <A HREF="http://www.springer.de/comp/lncs/authors.html.">http://www.springer.de/comp/lncs/authors.html.</A>

NOTE that the page limit is strict and longer papers will NOT be
reviewed. The paper should be sent either as a PostScript or as a Pdf
file. It should describe original, unpublished work, completed or in
progress, that is part of the doctoral work of the student(s). The
authors should be formatted as:

    Student(s): ...
    Supervisor(s): ...

If an extended version of the paper is also submitted to the technical
programme, THIS MUST BE INDICATED in the ABSTRACT of the paper. Double
submission is acceptable, but if the paper is accepted also for the
technical programme, the student will present the work only in the
technical programme sessions and not during the Doctoral Programme.
The papers of the students accepted for participation to the Doctoral
Programme will be made available on the web.


In addition, the dissertation advisor should send a letter of
recommendation by e-mail to cp-phd2006 @ deis.unibo.it. The letter
should:

    - confirm that the applicant is a Ph.D. student working in Constraint
Programming
    or its related fields;
    - indicate whether the student has already benefitted from the past CP
Doctoral Programmes,
    and if yes how many times;
    - include the expected  date for thesis submission;
    - and the motivation/expected benefit for the student to attend the
Doctoral Programme.

This letter can be sent in as either a text or a PostScript or a Pdf file.
