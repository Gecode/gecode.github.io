Dear Fredrik,

sorry for the delay but I was too busy with other stuff!

I have to admit that I still not fully understand what you try to do, but
maybe I can give some hints already:

Percentage requires division: but you can expresse division by using
multiplication!

As it comes to finding the most balanced choices, there are two possible
ways one can do that (at least in principle):
 1. Do best solution search that maximizes the balance.
 2. Come up with abranching scheme that delivers reasonable balance.

What is it what you want? How big will be the matrices?

Anyhow, to do 2. one most likely has to implement a new branching that does
the following:
 - select a column
 - select a field in the column and try values for that
Therefore one must implement a new branching. A starting point could be to
look at int/branch.hh and related files to find out how simple
variable/value selection-based branching is done. Much of this relies on
kernel/branching.icc which defines variable/value style branchings
parametrized over classes that find variables and values.

Sorry that I cannot be more helpful than that. But please try to ask again,
if this is not sufficient.

All the best
Christian

Subject: [gecode-users] Some help required by new gecode users


<Description>
We are currently trying to solve a problem using gecode, but cant quite get
it to work the way we want it to.

<Problem description>
For every column in the matrix, all choices must be present once. Not all
rows need to contain a choice, but for every column all choices must be
found in one of the rows. For every row, there is a corresponding constant
in constants. The sum of all choices in a row divided by the constant is put
in percentage. For the entire matrix, we want to find the distribution of
choices in the matrix so that percentage is as even as possible for all
rows.

<What we can't get to work>
We need some help with how to setup this problem. Currently we are branching
on x and while that does give us a valid solution, its not really the one we
are looking for. Ideally we would like to find the most balanced solution
(as determined by the deviation of percentage for every row in comparison to
percentage for the matrix as a whole), not just a solution as we are
currently.

If every row in the matrix consists of:
Xi1 * A1 + Xi2 * A2 + ... + Xin * An + Ri = row_max[i]

We want the smallest possible deviation of  Ri / row_max[i] for all i in the
row_max array.

There are currently two problems facing us. For one, we are unsure of what
relations to enter for percentage, and secondly we are unsure on how to make
gecode pick x for the matrix based on values in percentage.

The code so far looks like this:

Test(const Options& opt)
    : x(this, row_count*col_count, 0, row_sum) 
    {
        MiniModel::Matrix<IntVarArray> m(x, col_count, row_count);
        for (int w = 0; w < col_count; ++w) {
            linear(this, m.col(w), 
                IRT_EQ, col_sum[w], opt.icl);
            }

        IntArgs args(col_count);
        for (int e = 0; e < col_count; ++e)
            args[e] = col_constant[e];

        for (int h = 0; h < row_count; ++h) {
            linear(this, args, m.row(h), 
                IRT_LE, row_max[h], opt.icl);
            linear(this, m.row(h), 
                IRT_EQ, row_sum, opt.icl);
        }
        branch(this, x, BVAR_SIZE_MIN, BVAL_MED);
    }

Hi, I am currently a phD student in temporal planning and plan execution.

My planner embodies CSP techniques in order to check consistencies of 
constraint and to compute the minimal network, i.e. all solutions.
I need to write new propagation algorithm and the current CSP was not made in 
a way that permits to use them (AC|DC2 from B?rtak and Surynek).

An important feature is continuous domains. I check the list archive (not yet

No, there are no continuous domains in Gecode so far. But the good news is
that it should be easy enough to do.

Well, or at least: Gecode provides all interfaces and abstractions to add
new variable domains (as witnessed by CP(Graph)).

And maybe there are also other people interested in that?

I am very interested in doing that. I have an implementation of
continuous domains but with a very early gecode version (one where
views were not still implemented). It is not so difficult to add that
kind of variables. The only difficult thing is to have a portable
implementation because sometimes is necessary to change the machine
rounding mode but i think that libraries such as boost intervals
encapsulate this issue.


Currently i don't have much time to re-implement it but if you need
some help on doing this don't hesitate to ask and we can discuss some
ideas.

Regards,

I'm definitely interested! :-) Alas, I have no time at all for this....

Matthieu, if you need something now, try Mozart (www.mozart-oz.org) with 
the XRI module (http://home.gna.org/xrilpoz/). Note however that there 
are no edge-finding propagators for the continuous-domain variables in 
XRI. There are also a few minor bugs in XRI, but it's all listed in the 
mailing list and there are workarounds.

By the way, I've heard somewhere that the AVISPA group, the authors of 
XRI, work on integration of Mozart and GECODE. So maybe there will be a 
version of XRI for GECODE someday? (Or someone does this "from scratch" 
- XRI is in fact a rather thin wrapper around the smath library.)

One more question: how do you plan to employ AC|DC2?

Cheers,
Filip

Message-ID: <IYQWFH$62E0AC04451F42084BB523851DD6DC25@laposte.net>

Hi ! 

I would like to create an interface in order to post the same
constraint in several different spaces. I would have, for each
static posting function (post, distinct, etc...) a kind of
"super post" function, taking a list of spaces/variables and
posting, for each space passed in argument, the actual
constraint. 
The problem is that I didn't manage to find an exhaustive list
of all the static functions to post propagators. (I already
know some of them, like distinct or post for linear relations)
Is there such a list somewhere ? 

Another thing : concerning the post function ised in the
money.cc example, the link of the source code page sends me to
the definition of the 
void 	Gecode::Int::Linear::post (Space *home, Term t[], int n,
IntRelType r, int c, IntConLevel=ICL_DEF)
function, but, the argument doesn't correspond. Is it actually
this function which is called (in this case, I don't
understand the argument passing...) ? In the other case, where
is the actual post function used in this exemple defined ?

Hi,

you should find declarations of all post function in int.hh (and set.hh for
set constraints). This list is complete as no other post functions are
exported under Windows, so this information is always acurate! 

Your second question: oh my good, doxygen did it again ;-) Yes that is
definitely wrong! Obviously, Doxygen is confused by namespaces (I have to
admit it is not easy...). All this "post" can be found in minimodel.hh (or
explained in the minimodel docs).

After having continuous variables integrated we can use "elisa"
(http://sourceforge.net/projects/elisa/) as a good starting point for
building better propagators. I am not sure if the elisa license allows
it but i think some things can be done. The design of elisa is clear
and very modular so It won't be difficult to take some ideas from
there.

Sure, it will. The problem now is the time. Currently I am totally
concerned with the mozart-gecode integration (which is not quite
easy!) and don't have much time.

topics of tutorials in the previous CP conferences were: numerical CSPs,
global constraints, soft constraints, mathematical programming, cooperation
between methods, areas of application (eg. bioinformatics), etc.

Tutorials will take place during the technical program.

Important Dates for Tutorials
     * May 19, 2006: Proposal submission deadline
     * June 16, 2006: Acceptance notification
     * Mid August, 2006: Deadline for tutorial notes (TBD)

Hi

is there a predefined possibility to initialise an IntVar with the data

I found an initialisation via IntSet, that can be constructed by an int 
array. But that doesnt help, because there is no well conversion from 
std::set to int[].

Or is there a std::OutputIterator derived iterator class for IntVar, so 
I can use std::copy? I only found IntVarValues but the usage is not the

Thanks for help!

Hi Martin,

unfortunately there is no such thing... Actually, Gecode does not use much
from the C++ standard library so as to give uniform behavior across the
platform it runs on (and with the same performance). So you are on your own!
But if you do anyhting you feel worth being included in Gecode, please let
us know.

Christian

PS: Just create an array (preferably of ranges, that is: intervals), the
contructors of IntSet anyhow are expensive as they convert the set into some
normal form.

mhh.. ok I ll have a look if I can write a worthy conversion! ;)
Will have to have a deeper look into IntVar implementations..

Are there any predefined initialisation possibilities in addition to the
"min-max" range init?

Meanwhile, I am looking for set operations for IntSet variables like union
or intersection.
I am used to them by Mozart or Ilog. Are they available in Gecode?

Thanks for your help

Martin

Hi Martin,

unfortunately there is no such thing... Actually, Gecode does not use much
from the C++ standard library so as to give uniform behavior across the
platform it runs on (and with the same performance). So you are on your own!
But if you do anyhting you feel worth being included in Gecode, please let
us know.

Christian

PS: Just create an array (preferably of ranges, that is: intervals), the
contructors of IntSet anyhow are expensive as they convert the set into some
normal form.

Hi

is there a predefined possibility to initialise an IntVar with the data
of a std::set variable? Or just a nice/fast workaround?

I found an initialisation via IntSet, that can be constructed by an int
array. But that doesnt help, because there is no well conversion from
std::set to int[].

Or is there a std::OutputIterator derived iterator class for IntVar, so
I can use std::copy? I only found IntVarValues but the usage is not the
standard iterator behavior.

Thanks for help!

Martin

The interface of Gecode iterators has different requirements (typical
usage, efficiency) than the iterator-style used by STL.

If you need to use stl-iterators with Gecode and vice-versa, writing
wrappers to convert iterator-behaviour is not that complicated though.

Operations such as these are available for iterators in Gecode. The
documentation for these operations are available at [1]. For some more
information about iterators and views (used when implementing
propagators), see the paper at [2].

You can find two in the contribs/graph/view/iter.icc
They are called StlToGecodeRangeIterator and StlToGecodeValIterator
See example below.

They are available through iterator operations: union intersection, 
difference (see example below)

Thanks to Gr?goire Doom and his source code example I got the idea to 
write a Range iterator, that can be used in the constructor of a 
Gecode::IntSet object.

It is not a final solution, because I would like to have a direct 
conversion from std::set<int> to Gecode::IntVar, but with a 
Gecode::IntSet step between it is usable.

I didnt used the graph package, that already have got the feature 
std::iterator -> Gecode::Iterator, because I ve got trouble to compile 
the package on my cygwin system with the included boost version. I gave 
it up at the moment.

my class looks like that:

---------------------------------------------------------
/**
  * provides a constant Gecode RangeIterator of a std::set<int> that
  * calculates the ranges on demand.
  */
class GC_StlSetRangeIterator
{
  private:
    //! the set this iterator operates on
   const std::set<int>* data;
    //! the current position in data
   std::set<int>::const_iterator actElem;
    //! == true if the iterator has reached the end
   bool noFurtherRange;
     //! the current range
   int nextMin, nextMax;
     //! searchs for the next range and sets the inner members
   void getNextRange() {
     if (data==NULL || actElem == data->end()) {
       noFurtherRange = true;
       return;
     }
	 // init and identify next range
     nextMin = *actElem;
     nextMax = nextMin;
	 // build next range
     while ( (++actElem != data->end()) && (*actElem == (nextMax+1)))
       nextMax++;
   }

  public:
   GC_StlSetRangeIterator();
   GC_StlSetRangeIterator(const std::set<int>* data_);
   virtual ~GC_StlSetRangeIterator() {}

   void init(const std::set<int>* const data_) {
     data = data_;
     noFurtherRange = false;
     getNextRange();
   }
	
   bool operator()(void) const { return !noFurtherRange; }
   void operator++(void) { getNextRange(); }

   int min(void) const { return nextMin; }
   int max(void) const { return nextMax; }
   unsigned int width(void) { return nextMax-nextMin+1; }
};

----------------------------------------------------------------

and can be used like that:

----------------------------------------------------------------

#include <int.hh>
#include <set>
#include <iostream>
#include <GC_StlSetRangeIterator.hh>

int main(int argc, char** argv) {
   std::set<int> s;
   for(int i=0; i<5; i++) {
     s.insert(i);
     s.insert(i+7);
     s.insert(i*5);
   }

   GC_StlSetRangeIterator it(&s);

   Gecode::IntSet is(it);

   std::cout<<"new IntSet = " <<is <<std::endl;

   return 0;
}
----------------------------------------------------------------

there may be much better implementations or possibilies.. ;)

Thanks to all of you!

Martin

Could you tell me which version of Cygwin/boost you used ?

For a more direct version, do this:

IntVar i(home, Limits::Int::int_min(), Limits::Int::int_max()); // 
creates a -inf,+inf single range
GC_StlSetRangeIterator it(&s);
IntView iv(i); // modifiable wrapper  around Int var implementation
GECODE_ME_FAIL(home, iv.inter(it)); //modify upper bound of var by 
intersecting its ranges with the set iterator
cout << i << endl;

This way, you don't need to create the intermediate IntSet (and the 
intermediate vector as I did because I forgot the std::set was already 
sorted).

Best,

I am using cygwin web setup version 2.510.2.2 on windows xp prof.

this includes a boost library version 1.33.1-2

if I try to build the graph package, all went fine until the example 
build up. This crashes and also my code that was using the linked shared 
graph library..

I get this error:

hope this will help. maybe it's a configuration problem on my system..
but all is working fine so far.

I tried to build the boost library version 1.33.0 but the bjam tool made 
some strange things, threw a lot of errors and so I used the workaround..

Subject: [gecode-users] Constraint graph available?
Message-ID: <44636128.3040505@informatik.uni-freiburg.de>


I would like to use the structure of the constraint graph in my search 
strategy.
The constraint graph will be binary and the whole CSP will be formulated 
with binary constraints.

Is it possible to get a list of all NOT entailed constraints of a 
Gecode::Space? Or an other way to access this data without managing and 
updating an additional contraint graph in the space via adjacency list etc?



In addition I would like to know if it's possible to insert a contraint 
X and hinder X to propagate. The propagation should be done by 
constraint Y and X only used to test if X is entailed or not. For example:
3 vars A,B,C
1 distinct (ABC) with ICL_DOM for full propagation
2 neq constraints (AB) (BC)

(AB) and (BC) are included in (ABC), so they dont have to propagate.
i want to use (AB) and (BC) to test if this variables are not equal or not.
Or can I ask the global constraint (ABC) directly?

Seems to be my week of questions.. ;)
Hope you dont get bored!

Thanks for answers

Martin

This is something we (at UCLouvain) are investigating as an extention to 
CP(Graph).
I am afraid this is not going to be available before a couple of months.

There is no such method. The graph is there hidden in variable 
implementations and propagators but it would require some non trivial 
work to give it an API.

You could use reified disequality constraints:
 Gecode::rel (Space *home, IntVar x0, IntRelType r, IntVar x1, BoolVar 
b, IntConLevel icl=ICL_DEF)
The Boolean variable b becomes 1 as soon as the constraint x0 r x1 is 
entailed (use r=IRT_NQ for disequality).


My 2 cents,

Hi,

In addition to Gr?goire's comments, I would like to add the following.
If you would extract a constraint graph from a Space, your example
would not be binary, since you use a distinct-constraint. This mean
that you would also have to transform the graph semantically to
account for the fact that distinct represents a clique of not-equals,
if you want a binary graph.

However, there is one piece of information about the constraint-graph
that is exposed. Using the degree()-member of an IntVar variable will
return the number of constraints that subscribe to this variable. This
is used for the variable selection strategies BVAR_DEGREE_MIN and
BVAR_DEGREEE_MAX for branching on IntVar's.

Cheers
Mikael

Thanks you are right. Thats why I would like to introduce 
non-propagating binary constraints, to transfor it internally into a 
binary constraint graph. This can be used to check the binary pathes in 
the graph without loosing the stronger propagation via the global 
constraint e.g. distinct.
Think that the reified constraints, Gr?goire mentioned, will be usefull.

But never the less, this distinct/binary stuff is just something 
additional I m interested. The main focus is currently on real binary 
constraint graphs.

Great, that sounds very usefull. I ve not found this selection 
strategies until now!

Dear all,

The template is wrapped like that

typedef Gecode::BinaryPropagator<Gecode::Int::IntView,

Therefor the BinProp derived propagator is only called if one the two

My goal is a propagator that is called everytime the domain changes. So 
I set the PropCond template var from

PC_INT_VAL to PC_INT_DOM.

But now my propagator is not called anymore if the variable gets

Yes it still does! What makes you believe otherwise? Did you really try?

Really sure: _DOM means reexecution whenever a view changes in wahtever
form. However it does not mean that for each domain change the propagator is
executed once!

Hmm?

ok, I know that, but in my case it is not called anyway! mybe it's 
because of my cost or propagate function?

===========================
   Gecode::PropCost
   GC_Neighbored::cost(void) const {
     if (x0.assigned() || x1.assigned()) {
		return Gecode::PC_LINEAR_HI;
     }
     return Gecode::PC_QUADRATIC_HI;
   }

   Gecode::ExecStatus
   GC_Neighbored::propagate(Gecode::Space* home) {
     if (x0.assigned()) {

     }else if (x1.assigned()) {
       GECODE_ME_CHECK(removeNonNeighbors(home,x0,x1.val()));
     } else {
       GECODE_ME_CHECK(removeNonNeighbors(home));
     }
     return Gecode::ES_SUBSUMED;
   }
===========================

but I dont see anything different from the Gecode classes..

I m a bit confused as you can see.

This propagator will be called at most once. ES_SUBSUMED means that this
propagator won't contribute any more. The propagator will be called once
when it's posted (as every propagator is called then, except for those
that are subscribed to VAL), and then it disappears.
What you probably want to return is ES_FIX or ES_NONFIX, depending on
whether your propagator computes a fixpoint or not.

You are right... I m blind! The only position I ve not checked befor 
posting my problem..

Thanks for the final hint!

But I m a bit confused. My internal propagation functions 
"removeNonNeighbors" returns the ModEvents

- ME_GEN_FAILED (caught by the macro Gecode_ME_CHECK)
- ME_GEN_ASSIGNED (if both variables are assigned and fullfill my 
constraint)
- ME_GEN_NONE (if nothing changed via propagation
- ME_GEN_DOM (if on of the domain is changed)

in the case of ME_GEN_ASSIGNED the propagator is done and dont have to 
be recalled in this branch... ES_SUBSUMED should be the right return 
choice isnt it? or is ES_FIX my choice and a solution corresponds with a 
fixpoint at that point?

in the two remaining cases something else should be thrown but I m not 
sure what! ES_OK? ES_NOFIX???

Thank you

Martin

You have to return ES_SUBSUMED at the latest when all your variables are
assigned - otherwise the propagator will not be destroyed, resulting in a
space leak. You can return it earlier, when you detect that your
propagator doesn't have to be called again. For instance, in a propagator
for x<y, you can return ES_SUBSUMED once the maximum of x is smaller than
the minimum of y, even if neither is yet assigned.

> in the two remaining cases something else should be thrown but I m not

>From propagate, you should only return ES_FAILED, ES_SUBSUMED, ES_FIX, or
ES_NOFIX (and special versions of the latter two for staged propagation,
which you can ignore for now). Whether to return FIX or NOFIX depends on
whether you know that your propagator has reached a fixpoint. If unsure,
return NOFIX. This may result in your propagator being called too often
(which may be less efficient but correct). Returning FIX although you're
not at a fixpoint can result in the propagator being called not often
enough, and you might miss a failure: dangerous!

Not really, this is more tutorial knowledge: it is in noway Gecode specific,
so a ref doc is not the right place. But be sure, the tutorial will ramble
on and on on this.

Subject: [gecode-users] Gecode versus Ilog Solver
Message-ID: <446DBF90.9000807@informatik.uni-freiburg.de>

I want to give some short sentences about my experiences concerning Ilog 
Solver 6.1 and Gecode 1.1 constraint library in C++.

I formulated my CSP, a special search strategy and some contraint 
propagators both with Ilog and Gecode.

In my opinion the strict parting between modelling level and 
implementation level in Ilog makes its usage complicated. For branching 
or propagation you ve got to switch to implementation level and can use 
some macros to generate the modelling level. but thats no clear solution 
  for me. Your cant get a good interface (e.g. readable headers) for 
your modelling classes.
The solution of Gecode is better to handle and open for a deeper look 
into details.
As you can see in my often questioning: support is great for Gecode. The 
Ilog support people need at least a week for answering from my own 
experience. That's breaking hard in your programming progress. Thanks 
for your support! ;) (looking forward to your tutorial.. that will deal 
with the remaining starting problems!)

Summarising I can say that my developing and modelling time in Gecode is 
at least half than in Ilog. Maybe in part by a better knowledge of some 
techniques in such libraries now (tried Ilog first).

But in the end Gecode is so far easier to handle for me.. ;)

Think some enjoyable words are also nice for such a user list!

Martin

Message-ID: <6d69d7de0605220505k70743420y4dbd6cd67e66bd1d@mail.gmail.com>

Hi all,

Is it possible for each IntVar to see whether there is a constraint between
the IntVar and another IntVar?

I am looking for something like:
bool myfuntion(IntVar a, IntVar b)
that should return true only if there is at least a single constraint that
involves both a and b.

or
void myfunction(IntVar a, IntVarArgs b)

assigns b to be all IntVars that are present in the same constraints as a.

Also regarding the comparison between two IntVar variables a, b, I was
wondering if it is possible to check [NOT post] equality [whether the domain
of the two variables contain the same values] in a way that doesn't include
iterating over their values?

Best,
Stratos Kalogirou

That could be stated as one of our design principles ;-)

You're very welcome. Of course, one difference is that we can't give any 
guarantees that we're going to respond at all, while Ilog pays people for 
giving support. Of course, we'll try to do our best.

Concerning the tutorial, in fact, people asking questions gives us a good idea 
of what parts need special care. So, any feedback on what you consider 
especially difficult (or fairly easy) is welcome.

Hi.

No, currently not. And it would be quite hard to use because of entailment. 
Think of checking whether there's a constraint x<y. There might be a 
propagator ensuring x<y, there might also be a strictly stronger one ensuring 
x+1=y, or there might be none, as x<y is already entailed by the store.

Could you be a little more specific as to what you are planning to do with 
that information?

> Also regarding the comparison between two IntVar variables a, b, I was
> wondering if it is possible to check [NOT post] equality [whether the

Equality is, unlike in many other CP systems, not implemented via aliasing. 
This means that if you post "x=y", you actually post a propagator enforcing 
that. As already said above, you currently cannot check whether there is such 
a propagator.
If you only want to know whether two variables might be equal, i.e. whether 
the intersection of their domains is not empty, what's wrong with iterating 
over the domains?

	Guido

Is it the maximum ModEvent for this Variable since the space last was

Or is it the maximum ModEvent for this variable since the propagator was

Or something else ?

Hi,

Every Propagator contains a field called pme
(PropagatorModificationEvents). This field records the modification
events since the propagator was last run.

The member
  static ModeEvent pme(const Propagator*)
in variables in Gecode is a function that extracts the
modification-event for that variable-type. Note that the function is
static, so there is no "this variable". Views also have this function,
allowing them to do view-specific translations for the ModEvents.

The pme-field can also be used in conjunction with staged propagation.
See [1] for a description of the general idea. For an example, the
implementation of distinct uses this technique.

Hope this helps
Mikael

No, actually not. However it would be easy enough to add (but only with
linear complexity in the number of propagators). Should I?

I just added two functions propagators() and branchings() to the trunk
version that return the desired information but only if the space is stable.

I have a question about space stability and gecode. AFAIK, from mozart
and your PhD thesis, a space is stable when there are no
threads/propagators running. In the gecode case there are no threads
but only propagators (right?), so a space becomes stable after
performing propagation in it (i.e by calling the status method)? or
are there others situations when this can happen?


Thanks in advance,

Actually, you are right: only propagators are considered. There is am major
difference though compared to Oz in when stability is achieved: Only clone
and status make a space stable, commit in particular does not compute a
fixpoint (this is in order to support batch recomputation). So while
propagation in Oz is eager, it is lazy in Gecode.

Just for completeness, committing a space to an alternative without
giving a branching-description will compute a fixpoint first before
doing the branching.

The trunk is the current development version, it is available via svn (see
the webpage for details).

However, currently I cannot advise to use the trunk as it is broken
currently (I just realized that) and makes quite some incompatible changes
for those having implemented their own propagators (destructors will be
replaced by ordinary member functions so that arguments can be passed to

PS: By the way I just realized that these numbers are only available on
non-failed spaces otherwise one (should, I forgot that) will get an

Hi ! 

Great ! I was about to ask for the same functionnality :) However,
Christian, what do you call the Trunk version ? Is it a yet availiable
version or will it only be at the next release ?

Subject: [gecode-users] POsting boolean clauses
Message-ID: <44777F3B.8000506@laposte.net>

Hi !

Is it possible to simply post a propagator for disjunction of n boolean 
variables ? I only found the method :

void Gecode::bool_or 
<http://www.gecode.org/gecode-doc-latest/group__TaskIntIntBool.html#g8eb933148737bb8afb482e3f566c66b1> 
(Space *home, const BoolVarArgs &b, BoolVar c, IntConLevel 
<http://www.gecode.org/gecode-doc-latest/group__TaskIntInt.html#ga3e79a3496160feae2fd790c9379a319>=ICL_DEF)

in the documentation, but if I could do the same without having to 
create an extra variable already reduced to 1 to use as the c argument, 
it would be great !

Hi again ! 

Having had a look at my previous message, I realise that it is
not perfectly clear. The constraint I want to post is a
disjunction of litterals, i.e. a boolean variable or its
negation. (so, maybe the propagator I mentionned is not the
right one ?) 

I noticed that minimodel has a boolean expressions support,
but I didn't find any example using it. Is such an example
available anywhere ?

Dear Jeremie,

what you can do is the following:
	- for each negative literal, create a new var and post a propagator
bool_not
	- for the disjunction: just create a Boolean variable that is
assigned 1 and use that as
	  result for bool_or.

An example how to use the minimodel stuff is (assuming that b0, b1, b2 are
Boolean variables):
	post(<some space>, b0 | !b1 | b2)
returns a BoolVar reflecting the formula. If you want to state the formula
is true, just write
	post(<some space>, tt(b0 | !b1 | b2))

Hope that helps
Christian

We are pleased to announce the fourth Federated Logic Conference
(FLoC'06) to be held in Seattle, Washington, in August 2006, at the Seattle
Sheraton (http://www.easychair.org/FLoC-06/floc-hotel.html).

FLoC'06 promises to be the premier scientific meeting in computational logic
in 2006.  The following conferences will participate in FLoC'06:

CAV     Conference on Computer Aided Verification (Aug 17-20)
ICLP    Int'l Conference on Logic Programming (Aug 17-20)
IJCAR   Int'l Joint Conference on Automated Reasoning (Aug 17-20)
LICS    IEEE Symposium on Logic in Computer Science (Aug 12-15)

SAT     Int'l Conference on Theory and Applications of
         Satisfiability Testing (Aug 12-15)

The six major conferences will be accompanied by 41 workshops, held on Aug.
10-11, 15-16, and 21-22.

The FLoC'06 program includes a keynote session to commemorate the Goedel
Centenary, with John Dawson and Dana Scott as speakers, a keynote talk by
David Harel, plenary talks by Randy Bryant and David Dill, and invited talks
by F. Bacchus, A. Blass, B. Buchberger, A. Darwiche, M. Das, J. Esparza, J.
Giesl, A. Gordon, T. Hoare, O. Kupferman, M. Lam, D. Miller, K. Sakallah, J.
Stoy, and C. Welty.

FLoC has received an NSF grant to provide funds for travel grants of up to
$750 for student attendees of FLoC'06. We expect to award about 50 grants.
See application information on the website.

Seattle, the Emerald city, sits on the shores of Puget Sound surrounded by
mountains to the east and west.  Lovely views of blue waters and snow capped
peaks seem to appear everywhere - around the next bend in the road or
between the buildings downtown. Seattle is the gateway to the Pacific
Northwest, a premier tourist attraction. In Seattle, Mt. Rainier enchants
visitors; in Vancouver, British Columbia, the Coast Range juts out over
downtown; and in Portland, 5,000 acres of forestland north of the city
center harbor deer, elk, and the odd bear and cougar.

Online registration for FLoC is now open at:

        http://www.easychair.org/FLoC-06/

Deadline for preferred hotel rate is July 21, 2006.
Deadline for early registration is July 10, 2006.

Hi everyone.

Due to a hard disk failure, our server hasn't been fully available since last 
weekend. We have replaced the disk now and recovered its contents from last 
night's backup.
Fortunately, this disk contained only the /services (or /srv) mountpoint, 
which means that home directories were not affected. We hope that the system 
will run more stable now and apologize for any inconvenience.

Cheers,

Subject: [gecode-users] Retrieval of status and elimination of the SS_BRANCH
	case
Message-ID: <6d69d7de0605300650h547e9aeg79453e293b7dc668@mail.gmail.com>

Hi all,

I am using the status method to get the status of my space. In case the
status returns SS_BRANCH I would like to branch the search tree and find out
if the status is SS_SOLVED or SS_FAILED. In other words I want to eliminate
the case where the status returns SS_BRANCH [only solved or failed spaces
are accepted]. I am doing something like:

QSpace* qs=new QSpace;   //this is a subclass of Space where my problem is
defined
  qs->getStatus();                //this is where I print the status of my
space. In my case this returns SS_BRANCH
  DFS<QSpace> e(qs,25,200);  //this is where I am using the Depth First
Engine to search through the tree
  qs->getStatus();                //this is where I would expect to see
either SS_SOLVED or SS_FAILED but not SS_BRANCH

The problem is that after the second retrieval of the status I get again
SS_BRANCH. What am I doing wrong?

Best,
Stratos Kalogirou

You only construct the search engine, but don't actually perform any search. 
To do that, call e.next(). It either returns you a new QSpace that is a 
solution, or NULL if there was no solution. Note that, as Gecode's search is 
based on copying, the search engine really returns a copy of your original 
space.

	Guido

No, it has not been done (yet) in Gecode (even though, we just started some
work for having scheduling support). I also do not know any other freely
accesible solution.

Subject: [gecode-users] constraint graphs via boolvars
Message-ID: <447D9A18.1040103@informatik.uni-freiburg.de>

Greetings,

I m currently thinking about an implementation of a more or less 
bruteforce implementation of a binary constraint graph. my idea is like 
that:

1) i ve got an array of n IntVars = D[0..n-1]

2) a BoolVar derived subclass EdgeVar manages 2 indices in (0..n-1) in 
addition to the normal BoolVar data

3) for each binary constraint c I introduce an EdgeVar connected to a 
corresponding reified constraint

4) i create an adjacency list to represent the constraint graph

so far no prob..

now i want that:
- if an EdgeVar becomes assigned, i remove the corresponding entries 
from the adjancency list

thats the point I m currently stucked ..

whats the best way to do?
theoretically the constraint graph and therefor the adjacency list is an 
n-ary constraint over the EdgeVars. So my first idea is to derive the 
adjecency list from Gecode::Propagator, to get notified of the 
assignments... but cant find a way to subscribe this "global" constraint 
to the EdgeVars.

currently i build the complete adjacency list from the EdgeVar objects, 
everytime i need the constraint graph. but i think thats nothing 
effective.. :)

hope you can help and have an idea

Martin
