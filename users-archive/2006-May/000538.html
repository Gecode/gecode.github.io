<PRE>I want to give some short sentences about my experiences concerning Ilog 
Solver 6.1 and Gecode 1.1 constraint library in C++.

I formulated my CSP, a special search strategy and some contraint 
propagators both with Ilog and Gecode.

In my opinion the strict parting between modelling level and 
implementation level in Ilog makes its usage complicated. For branching 
or propagation you ve got to switch to implementation level and can use 
some macros to generate the modelling level. but thats no clear solution 
  for me. Your cant get a good interface (e.g. readable headers) for 
your modelling classes.
The solution of Gecode is better to handle and open for a deeper look 
into details.
As you can see in my often questioning: support is great for Gecode. The 
Ilog support people need at least a week for answering from my own 
experience. That's breaking hard in your programming progress. Thanks 
for your support! ;) (looking forward to your tutorial.. that will deal 
with the remaining starting problems!)

Summarising I can say that my developing and modelling time in Gecode is 
at least half than in Ilog. Maybe in part by a better knowledge of some 
techniques in such libraries now (tried Ilog first).

But in the end Gecode is so far easier to handle for me.. ;)

Think some enjoyable words are also nice for such a user list!

Cheers,
Martin
