<PRE>Hi.

&gt;<i> Is it possible for each IntVar to see whether there is a constraint between
</I>&gt;<i> the IntVar and another IntVar?
</I>
No, currently not. And it would be quite hard to use because of entailment. 
Think of checking whether there's a constraint x&lt;y. There might be a 
propagator ensuring x&lt;y, there might also be a strictly stronger one ensuring 
x+1=y, or there might be none, as x&lt;y is already entailed by the store.

&gt;<i> I am looking for something like:
</I>&gt;<i> bool myfuntion(IntVar a, IntVar b)
</I>&gt;<i> that should return true only if there is at least a single constraint that
</I>&gt;<i> involves both a and b.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> or
</I>&gt;<i> void myfunction(IntVar a, IntVarArgs b)
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> assigns b to be all IntVars that are present in the same constraints as a.
</I>
Could you be a little more specific as to what you are planning to do with 
that information?

&gt;<i> Also regarding the comparison between two IntVar variables a, b, I was
</I>&gt;<i> wondering if it is possible to check [NOT post] equality [whether the
</I>&gt;<i> domain of the two variables contain the same values] in a way that doesn't
</I>&gt;<i> include iterating over their values?
</I>
Equality is, unlike in many other CP systems, not implemented via aliasing. 
This means that if you post &quot;x=y&quot;, you actually post a propagator enforcing 
that. As already said above, you currently cannot check whether there is such 
a propagator.
If you only want to know whether two variables might be equal, i.e. whether 
the intersection of their domains is not empty, what's wrong with iterating 
over the domains?

Cheers,
	Guido
