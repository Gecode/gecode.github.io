Subject: [gecode-users] GecodeJ : java.lang.UnsatisfiedLinkError
Message-ID: <4547E128.3060301@student.uclouvain.be>

Hi,

I'm trying to solve a gecodeJ problem by a popen("java SolveProblem", 
"r") in a C++ code of an add-on of OpenOffice.

I'm getting this error :

Gecode native code library failed to load.
java.lang.UnsatisfiedLinkError: 
/usr/local/gecode/release-1.0.0/libgecodejava.so: 
/opt/openoffice.org2.0/program/libstdc++.so.6: version `CXXABI_1.3.1' 
not found (required by /usr/local/gecode/release-1.0.0/libgecodejava.so)

I have several different libstdc++.so.6 file on my disk. One is in 
/opt/openoffice.org2.0/program. it seems not to be the good version, but 
I think I can't replace it because OpenOffice maybe needs this version...

Furthermore, I don't know how to know which version I have.

I 've tried to run java SolveProblem directly in the console and there 
is no error.

Can anybody help me ?

Thanks alot,

Mika?l

You could try to compile gecode and gecodeJ with the same compiler as 
you used for your openoffice add-on and make sure they are linked 
against /opt/openoffice.org2.0/program/libstdc++.so.6

My guess is that your gecode libraries use libstdc++.so.6 with a 
different C++ ABI version.

Maybe someone  on this list is more familiar to these libstdc++ version 
problems than me, or you could try to ask that question on a g++ users list.

All the best with your project

Hello,
I should have thought twice before replying.

Instead of caling popen("java SolveProblem"), wrap up the java 
SolveProblem call in a shell script which ensures your LD_LIBRARY_PATH 
points to the right libstdc++ first.

solveproblem.sh:
export 
LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/usr/lib:/usr/local/lib:/usr/local/gecode/release-1.0.0/
# this one should produce the same result as when executed in
# a command line context where your java program works
ldd /usr/local/gecode/release-1.0.0/libgecodejava.so > /tmp/ldd.log
java SolveProblem


By the way, many changes and bugfixes have occured in gecode since 
1.0.0; you should probably upgrade.

Subject: [gecode-users] view selection combinator
Message-ID: <4564DEB0.8040007@informatik.uni-freiburg.de>

Hello,

I had the idea to write a hierarchical combinator VC (will be a 
viewselector itself) for two ViewSelectors V1 and V2, that does the 
following: for a view v it first asks V1 about v. if V1 says "better" v 
is accepted (VC returns VSS_SELECT). if V1 says "equal" VC asks V2 about 
v. if V2 says "better" v is accepted by VB else rejected or "equal" 
returned.

The application is a free combination of existing view selections for 
test reasons and to find the best view selection for my problem. I think 
this is something other may be interested in too. For instance you ve 
got a fast V1 for a first ordering and a more expensive V2 for a 
detailed selection. a combinator would be great, because otherwise you 
ve got to apply the expensive V2 always to all views.

Now comes my problem: the possible return values of ViewSelectors:

enum  	Gecode::ViewSelStatus {
    Gecode::VSS_NONE,   // not better
    Gecode::VSS_SELECT, // is better
    Gecode::VSS_COMMIT  // is the best ever
}

i ve got no possibility to get or return the information "is as good as 
last best seen". as far as i can see it wont be a big deal to introduce 
this into the enum and the existing standard viewselectors if you think 
that it is worthy. e.g. as second a VSS_ALIKE. by that you wont change 
your interface and no changes in the branchings are neccessary.
I can send you the template code of the combinator when its done if you 
like the idea.. ;)

maybe the "alike" information can be usefull somewhere else too. but 
right now i ve got no further good idea.

thanks for interest,

martin

Great, I need this.
I would call V2 a tie-breaking strategy for V1.

Looks good, indeed. If you check our plans for 2.0 you'll tie-breaking on
our list:
	http://www.gecode.org/future.html

The hard part, however is how to specify in a model without hacking new
branchings and not compromising efficiency.

;) Ok Greg,

now we are two! ;)
Tie-breaking sounds great, but anyway it wont function without the 
"alike" support of the ViewSelStatus..

Hi Christian,

i didnt knew about the roadmap but it looks fine.
Have you already concrete plans for the tie-breaking combinator?

Additionally I would like to take into account more than one view to 
evaluate the view in focus. but for something like that i would have to 
write my own branching right? Seems to be more problemspecific than the 
tie-breaking..

Thanks,
Martin

Hi everyone.

I have set up forwarding of the Gecode mailing lists to the gmane gateway,
which will from now on provide nicely formatted archives as well as a news
(nntp) interface to our lists.

Please visit http://gmane.org for further information. The Gecode lists
should appear under gmane.comp.lib.gecode.{announce, users} when the first
mail (i.e., this mail) arrives there. I will also ask the gmane
administrators to import our archives.

Cheers,

Hello,

I'm using Gecode 1.2.2 and am wondering if there is a common practice
for declaring n-dimensional matrices of integer variables, with n > 2
(From what I see, MiniModel::Matrix is for 2-d matrices).

Can it be done using the available variable array classes? (building
arrays of arrays of IntVarArrays) ?

Hi,

The Matrix class is, as you've correctly identified, a 2-d matrix class.

Before we had the Matrix class, our common practice for matrices was
to declare an IntVarArray and then to write accessor-functions like to
following

    IntVar& y(int i, int j) {
      return x[i*n*n+j];
    }

This idea can be naturally extended to handle more than two dimensions.

Cheers,
Mikael
