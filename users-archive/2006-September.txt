                             CP 2006
               Twelfth International Conference on
        Principles and Practice of Constraint Programming


                      September 24-29, 2006
                Cit? des Congr?s - Nantes, France

            http://www.sciences.univ-nantes.fr/cp06/

Latest news

The conference web site now features the complete conference
program, and links to all workshops and the doctoral program.


Description

The CP conference is the annual international conference on
constraint programming, and it is concerned with all aspects of
computing with constraints, including: algorithms, applications,
environments, languages, models, and systems. CP 2006 includes a
technical program, where presentations of theoretical and
application papers, as well as invited talks and tutorials, aim
at describing the best results and techniques in the
state-of-the-art of constraint programming. Moreover, CP 2006
continues the tradition of the CP doctoral program, in which PhD
students can present their work, listen to tutorials on career
and ethical issues, and discuss their work with senior
researchers via a mentoring scheme. There will also be a number
of workshops, where researchers will be able to meet in an
informal setting and discuss their most recent ideas with their
peers.

Special events

CP 2006 will open on Sunday 24 September with CP-Tools-06, the
first event in a yearly series addressing CP systems design and
application development. During the conference, the 2006 ACP
award will be given and a plenary half day workshop will be
dedicated to the "next ten years of Constraint Programming". The
conference program includes invited talks by Shabbir Ahmed
(Global optimization of probabilistically constrained linear
programs), Guiseppe Italiano (Algorithms and Constraint
Programming), Jean-Pierre Merlet (Interval analysis and
robotics), and Helmut Simonis (Constraint Based Resilience
Analysis).

Conference site

CP 2006 will be held at the Nantes Cit? des Congr?s. Nantes is a
major center of the European West and the sixth largest town in
France. The city, which is located on the Loire Estuary and 50km
from the Atlantic coast, is famous for enjoying an exceptional
quality of life. Nantes is at the heart of a highly efficient
transportation network (high-speed trains from Paris, airport,
motorways, tramway). The Nantes Cit? des Congr?s is directly
accessible by shuttle from the airport, by bus from the city
center, and is within ten-minute walking distance from the city
center and the high-speed train station.

Registration and accommodation

All relevant information can be found on the conference's main
web page,

First International Day on Constraint Programming Tools (CP-TOOLS-06)

		   (In conjunction with CP'06)
		       September 24, 2006
		      URL: www.cptools.org


Update
======

The webpage now features the program and lists all eleven systems
to be presented at CP-TOOLS-06.


Description
===========

Much of the success and recognition of constraint programming
stems from constraint programming systems and their successful
use for practical applications. By providing rich languages and
sophisticated implementations, constraint programming tools model
complex applications, shorten development time, and produce code
that is easier to maintain and extend.

The goal of CP-TOOLS series is to foster the development of
constraint programming tools, to showcase their applications, to
educate young researchers in the use of CP tools, and to
encourage cross-fertilization in tool development. CP-TOOLS-06 is
the first event in this series that will take place yearly in
conjunction to a major conference.

The theme of the first day in the series is to expose young
researchers to a broad set of constraint-programming tools, to
the system-oriented research process, and to research themes in
the area. The CP-Tools program will consist of two invited talks
exploring these issues from industrial and academic standpoints,
presentations of the participating systems, and two panels. The
system presentations will collectively present the spectrum of
capabilities available in modern CP tools. The first panel will
focus on promoting system research and will discuss what makes it
so unique. The second panel will approach research themes and
trends that participants are exploring or are poised to
explore. Participating systems may be commercial or academic and
are expected to be available.

Hello,

I'm new to Gecode but have some experience with ILOG Solver.

As I'm crawling through the reference documentation, and the examples, I
have stumbled across the following problem.
Suppose I want to find the maximal value of X [0..100] such that X < 10,
how do I model this (the maximization objective - the simple constraint
problem has turned up in the mailing list archives)?

I have taken a look (inspired by the n-queens example) at BAB and the
function constrain() added to the problem class, but I have not been
able to let my problem return X = 9 so far - even after fiddling with
the BAB and constrain() function, my problem still returns X = [0..9]
What's the simple (and correct) way of doing this?

Thanks,
Pieter

Using the constrain function and the BAB search engine is already the  
right direction. Maybe you forgot to add a branching to the space?  
That would explain why your variable is not instantiated.

Hi all,

I don't understand why the following program fails,

I only want to create a propagator for
a*b=:tmp, where a=:316 and b=:120
so after the propagation (status) tmp is going to be equal to 37920, and
that is the value that tmp shows in the last line of the program, but the
status of  A is failed ????

#include "gecode/int.hh"
#include "gecode/kernel.hh"
#include <iostream>

using namespace Gecode;

class Alejo : public Space {
public:
  Alejo(void) {}
  virtual Space* copy(bool share) {
    return new Alejo(*this);
  }
};

int main() {
  Alejo A;
  IntVar a(&A,0,100000);
  IntVar b(&A,0,100000);
  IntVar tmp(&A,Gecode::Limits::Int::int_min, Gecode::Limits::Int::int_max);

  mult(&A,a,b,tmp);
  eq(&A,a,316);
  eq(&A,b,120);

  unsigned long pp;
  SpaceStatus estado = A.status(pp);

  if(estado==SS_FAILED) std::cout<<"FAILED"<<std::endl;
  if(estado==SS_SOLVED) std::cout<<"OK"<<std::endl;
  std::cout<<"A: "<<a<<" B: "<<b<<" tmp: "<<tmp<<std::endl;
  return 0;
}


Cheers

I test the code, the status of A was solved ;)

The output was:

OK
A: 316 B: 120 tmp: 37920

My enviroment is:
- gecode-1.2.2
- g++-4.1
- Debian sid


update your gecode ???

Hello Alejandro,

When I tried your program with Gecode 1.2.2 it worked as it should,
i.e., it printed
OK
A: 316 B: 120 tmp: 37920

What version of Gecode are you using? What platform are you using it on?

Cheers,
Mikael

Please, let me reiterate the issues raised in the two previous replies:

	Never, never ever, report a problem without telling
		- Gecode version number
		- platform used (operating system plus C++ compiler)

In this case, early versions of Gecode had actually a bug in multiplication
(but actually not incorrectness just a  quirk). So did you double check that
the program you wrote is the program you executed?

Hi, 
 

 I tried to compile the program again, and when I compile gecode without debug the program fails (i.e prints FAILED), but when I compile gecode with debug the program works very well (i.e prints OK).
 
 
 I'm working with: 
 gecode-1.2.2 
 g++-4.03
 ubuntu 6.04
 


Thanks for the help
Alejandro

Hi, all!

This is the first time I've tried to build gecode. My set-up: gecode
version 1.2.2 on WinXP with cygwin and Visual C++ 2005 Express. When
making it, I receive the following msg:

What I find curious is that I couldn't spot a reference to a cp library
either in the output or in the Makefile...

Thanks in advance for any pointers. Cheers,

Jorge.

This is one of the standard libraries that come with the Microsoft  
compiler, and the linker should always be able to find it. It seems  
that either your installation is broken or some paths are not  
correctly set up.
The Visual C++ express edition comes with a batch file that sets up  
the paths correctly (called something like vcvarsall.bat IIRC). When  
you use cygwin, you may have to invoke that file manually.

To check that all the paths are correct, try to compile a simple  
helloworld program from the command line.

Cheers,

Thank you very much for your reply, Guido! You gave me the hint that was
missing. According to MS
(http://msdn2.microsoft.com/en-us/library/abx4dbyh.aspx) libcp.lib does
not exist anymore and one is bound to choose between alternative libs by
means of command-line options to cl. Any of -MD (no-debug dynamic link to
C++ runtime library), -MT (static), -MDd or -MTd (debug versions). So what
I've done is (manually) to add the necessary flag to the "export DLLFLAGS
..." line in the Makefile. Surely it might be best to add an option to
configure whose interpretation depends on the setting for (no)debug.
Unfortunately, I don't know how to do that.

Hi All,
 
 I think the problem  I am facing  with multiplication isn't in the propagator, it is related with gcc optimization flags and function inlining. I have  tried the code in  Pentium 4 and Xeon pcs (with  ubuntu 6.0.3:  g++ 4.0.3, gecode-1.2.2),  and the program fails. I also tried it in a power pc (g++ 4.0.3, gecode-1.2.2 and ubuntu 6.0.3)  and it worked. I realized that some compiler flags have a strong inpact:  -ffast-math and -O3. When building gecode with -ffast-math and without -O3 or with -O3 and without -ffast-math the program works very well. Both compiler flags seems to be not compatible in this case (processor + gcc version). Even further, when debug option is turned on from configure all works (i think debug option disables compiler optimization and function inlining).
 
 In my particular case the problem is with c_d function at line 45 of gecode/int/arithmetic/mult.icc, because the function has forceinline, I think that the compiler produces some wrong optimized code. Telling gcc to not inline this function also solves the problem in both pcs.
 
 

 Cheers
 Alejandro

In this case, early versions of Gecode had actually a bug in multiplication
(but actually not incorrectness just a  quirk). So did you double check that
the program you wrote is the program you executed?

Hello Alejandro,

When I tried your program with Gecode 1.2.2 it worked as it should, i.e., it
printed OK
A: 316 B: 120 tmp: 37920

What version of Gecode are you using? What platform are you using it on?

I've also tried to investigate this, but I can't reproduce the  
problem here on my machines. However, it seems we're pushing gcc to  
the limit as it comes to inlining. On Intel Macs with Mac OS X, some  
set propagators go into infinite loops, and I haven't been able to  
figure out yet what goes wrong. Removing -ffast-math didn't have any  
positive effect on this, only disabling inlining makes things work.

Right, in particular it disables inlining and forces the compiler to  
put all functions in some object file. I'm not really sure how to  
debug this, it's hard to hunt bugs that only appear in non-debug  
builds under very special conditions... Often, already putting some  
cout statements into the code changes the behaviour. Very weird.

Cheers,
	Guido

Subject: [gecode-users] Newbie: space/solution copying & dynamically added
	constraints
Message-ID: <450FEE92.1040409@ugent.be>

Hello,

I'm currently running Gecode 1.2.2 on debian Sarge and am using its
built-in BAB engine to solve a constraint optimization problem.

As I want to parallelize the search procedure (by using concurrent
distributed components) but haven't discovered such a solution in gecode
(does it exist already?), I have been entertaining myself by
implementing a prototype of such a concurrent distributed search
procedure using MPICH2, in which the concurrent components perform load
distribution by dynamically splitting up their assigned search space.

As it's just a prototype, I don't mind it being slightly naive.
Therefore, I use the Gecode-provided BAB search engine in each of the
components. When some component has finished its search, it will request
work from a busy component. Work consists of a description of variables
to be bound, so the querying component will start a new search in the
problem space constrained by these bound variables. These variable
bindings can easily be passed on using MPI messages.

My main problem, however, lies with controlling the BAB search engine
dynamically. Consider this (naive) approach:

BAB<solution> engine(...);
do {
   solution* currentSolution =  engine.next()

   currentSolution->getWorkToDistribute();
} while ...

The goal of the getWorkToDistribute call is to split the remaining
search space to be explored by engine.next() in two parts by a binary
split on some variable: one part will be assigned to a worker process
asking for work (and thus, the description of this part of the search
space will be distributed using MPI calls), and the  remainder will be
explored by this process's engine.next().

My problem lies with the latter.  Assuming that we have split the search
space on variable X, and that X=1 will be explored by the remote
process, I now want to "dynamically" constrain this process's search
space by adding "X <> 1".

Is there a way to achieve this without recreating the whole problem,
adding the extra constraint "X <> 1" and starting a new search engine
(probably revisiting lots of nodes)?

I'm asking because I'm really not sure how and when the search engine
copies solution objects.  It seems that naively  "adding" a constraint
to the currentSolution object does not have the effect I want.

Then I thought of the "constrain" function called by the BAB engine,
used to dynamically constrain the cost function. However, I'm not sure
when it is called, nor what the relationship is between the argument
passed to this function and previous values of currentSolution in the loop.
That is, I tried currentSolution->setSomeMemberData hoping that
currentSolution would be passed as argument to the constrain() function
of another node, but upon examination in the constrain() function the
envisioned member data does not have said member data. (My idea was to
read this member data - representing the constraint to be added "X <> 1"
- from the argument to constrain() : Space *s  - and add this constraint
to "this" just like reading the value of the cost function from Space s
and then adding a constraint requiring the cost to be less)

Can anyone enlighten me and tell me where my ideas are just plain wrong
or what I should try instead?

As an additional question: in the above code snippet, useful things
(aside from searching, that is) can only be performed when engine.next()
returns. Are there Pause/Resume objects or operators that will interrupt
the search procedure more timely but still allow the search engine to
continue afterwards?

Thanks
Pieter

Hi Peter,

looks interesting ;-) The basic insight that all search engines use is that
they do not manipulate the variables directly: instead they use the
branchings together with branching descriptions as a problem-independent
device to do so. A branching description contains space-independent
information about which variable and about how that variable is to be
constrained when used with a commit operation on a space: the commit
operation finds the appropriate branching and the branching then uses the
branching description to constraint the right variable accordingly.

What you could do to make the search distributed is to cook up an operation
for a branching description that turns it into something that can be send
over the wire: should not be to hard, the typical description contains just
two integers. Then in order to hand out a node, you just start from the same
basic space and add all branching descriptions corresponding to the path
leading to the node you want to explore (this is recomputation and looking
how recomputation is done in the search engines should give you an idea).

Much of the way search is done has been inherited from Mozart (apart from
batch recomputation). If you want to see an architecture for distributed
parallel search based on spaces, you might want to check:
	http://web.it.kth.se/~schulte/paper.html?id=Schulte:TRICS:2000

Subject: [gecode-users] Newbie: space/solution copying & dynamically
addedconstraints


Hello,

I'm currently running Gecode 1.2.2 on debian Sarge and am using its built-in
BAB engine to solve a constraint optimization problem.

As I want to parallelize the search procedure (by using concurrent
distributed components) but haven't discovered such a solution in gecode
(does it exist already?), I have been entertaining myself by implementing a
prototype of such a concurrent distributed search procedure using MPICH2, in
which the concurrent components perform load distribution by dynamically
splitting up their assigned search space.

As it's just a prototype, I don't mind it being slightly naive. Therefore, I
use the Gecode-provided BAB search engine in each of the components. When
some component has finished its search, it will request work from a busy
component. Work consists of a description of variables to be bound, so the
querying component will start a new search in the problem space constrained
by these bound variables. These variable bindings can easily be passed on
using MPI messages.

My main problem, however, lies with controlling the BAB search engine
dynamically. Consider this (naive) approach:

BAB<solution> engine(...);
do {
   solution* currentSolution =  engine.next()

   currentSolution->getWorkToDistribute();
} while ...

The goal of the getWorkToDistribute call is to split the remaining search
space to be explored by engine.next() in two parts by a binary split on some
variable: one part will be assigned to a worker process asking for work (and
thus, the description of this part of the search space will be distributed
using MPI calls), and the  remainder will be explored by this process's
engine.next().

My problem lies with the latter.  Assuming that we have split the search
space on variable X, and that X=1 will be explored by the remote process, I
now want to "dynamically" constrain this process's search space by adding "X
<> 1".

Is there a way to achieve this without recreating the whole problem, adding
the extra constraint "X <> 1" and starting a new search engine (probably
revisiting lots of nodes)?

I'm asking because I'm really not sure how and when the search engine copies
solution objects.  It seems that naively  "adding" a constraint to the
currentSolution object does not have the effect I want.

Then I thought of the "constrain" function called by the BAB engine, used to
dynamically constrain the cost function. However, I'm not sure when it is
called, nor what the relationship is between the argument passed to this
function and previous values of currentSolution in the loop. That is, I
tried currentSolution->setSomeMemberData hoping that currentSolution would
be passed as argument to the constrain() function of another node, but upon
examination in the constrain() function the envisioned member data does not
have said member data. (My idea was to read this member data - representing
the constraint to be added "X <> 1"
- from the argument to constrain() : Space *s  - and add this constraint to
"this" just like reading the value of the cost function from Space s and
then adding a constraint requiring the cost to be less)

Can anyone enlighten me and tell me where my ideas are just plain wrong or
what I should try instead?

As an additional question: in the above code snippet, useful things (aside
from searching, that is) can only be performed when engine.next() returns.
Are there Pause/Resume objects or operators that will interrupt the search
procedure more timely but still allow the search engine to continue
afterwards?

Thanks
Pieter

Hi all,

Is any different creating variables like

IntVar a(s, 0,Gecode::Limits::Int::int_max+10);

than

IntVar a;
a.init(s,0,Gecode::Limits::Int::int_max+10);

because when I tried to declare a variable with the first one, the program
returns an exception (that is OK because the domain is greater that the
limits), but when I tried with the second one, the program didn't return an
exception.


for example: in the following program, ttt is greater than gecode limits.


I'm working with:
Ubuntu 6.06: g++ 4.0.3 and gecode-1.3.0



#include "gecode/int.hh"
#include "gecode/kernel.hh"
#include <iostream>

using namespace Gecode;

class ZZZ : public Space {
public:
  ZZZ(void) {}
  virtual Space* copy(bool share) {
    return new ZZZ(*this);
  }
};

int main() {
  ZZZ A;
  IntVar ttt;
  IntSet bb(Gecode::Limits::Int::int_max+3,Gecode::Limits::Int::int_max+10);

  ////ttt.init(&A,bb);
  ttt.init(&A,0,Gecode::Limits::Int::int_max+3);

  std::cout<<"max: "<<Limits::Int::int_max<<std::endl;
  std::cout<<"ttt: "<<ttt<<std::endl;

  unsigned long pp;
  SpaceStatus estado = A.status(pp);

  if(estado==SS_FAILED) std::cout<<"FAILED"<<std::endl;

That's clearly a bug: init should also raise an exception (even the docs say
so). It's called limits because they are the limits ;-)
 
Thanks for pointing out. I'll fix it tomorrow in the trunk.

When posting disjunctions in Gecode, they are handled via reification.
Reified constraints typically have very weak propagation, in many
cases the propagation will not amount to more than checking that the
constraint does in fact hold.

There are techniques, such as constructive disjunction for example,
for stronger propagation of disjunctions, but these are not available
currently in Gecode. Also, these techniques are typically not very
efficient.

This would only be an explicit way of creating the reified constraints
show above, so there would be no difference in propagation.

Hope this helps,
Mikael

Well, for the time being, I'm distributing variable-range restrictions to
remote nodes as branching descriptions. I then construct a new problem
instance with these extra variable-range restrictions and start a new search
engine. The problem I had been bitten by previously (having difficulties in
passing dynamic information to the search) which presumably had to do with
copying spaces etc. has been "solved" by observing that I'm only running one
search engine per MPI process, so I can do with global variables (ugh).

I might fall back to the worker/manager paradigm described there, as I
started out with a set of worker-peers (no central manager) but that might
be more difficult - less efficient.

Can you enlighten me: I've only used stop objects to, well, stop (i.e.
terminate) searches.

Suppose I'm in a loop like

do {
  solution* currentSolution = engine.next();
  statement;
}

For testing purposes, I have initialized the search engine with a custom
Stop object whose stop() function always returns true, and it turns out that
upon termination currentSolution becomes NULL.

I thought about implementing pause/restart by creating a new engine using
the last value of currentSolution as root node, but as currentSolution is
NULL upon termination of the search this seems impossible or is it not?

Oh, I see: you can reset a stop object!

It goes as follows:
 - if you get NULL as a solution you check on the search engine whether
search is done (no solution found)
   or whether search has been stopped (stopped()).
 - If it is has been stopped, just reset the stop object to your liking (for
time, reset the time, for failures increase the afilure limit, etc).

If you need your own stop object just make it resetable.

Basically, what I'd like is to repat a loop like

search for 10 minutes
check for pending MPI messages and respond
continue search

Attaching a 10-minute stop object to the search engine will indeed return
after some 10 minutes. But how do I continue the search?

Do I simply call engine.next() again to continue?

Thanks,
Pieter

Message-ID: <63b5c8b00609210650v5629d78akea5bc3fe71f393d4@mail.gmail.com>

We would like to announce the release of

		    Gecode/J 1.0.0
	    http://www.gecode.org/gecodej

Gecode/J is a Java interface to the Gecode C++ constraint progamming
library. Gecode/J is mainly aimed at education, presenting a slightly
simplified interface compared to Gecode. Using Gecode/J, modeling
constraint problems, programming custom propagators, branchings, and
search engines is possible directly in Java. There is also an
interactive graphical search tool, the Gecode/J Explorer, available.


Familiar langauge
  Many students are already familiar with Java, making it easier for
  them to use the library.

Free
  Gecode/J is licensed under a BSD-style license, the same as
  Gecode. All parts, including both source code and documentation, are
  available for download and use.

Graphical search
  The Gecode/J Exoplorer enables graphical search, both interactive
  and using depth-first or branch-and-bound search. It is possible to
  inspect nodes both before and after propagation as well as to write
  custom inspection actions, for example to give a graphical view of
  the problem state.

  The Gecode/J Explorer is written completely in Java, using the
  Gecode/J interface. It can be ported to other Space-based systems.

Extensible
  It is possible to write custom propagators, branchings, and search
  engines in Java, without needing to write a single line of C++ code.

  For extensions to the base Gecode-library, such as new variable-
  domains or constraints, these can be added to Gecode/J with reltive
  ease.

Documentation
  Gecode/J comes with extensive reference documentation.


Cheers,
    The Gecode/J Team

Hello everyone!

We (that is Christian, Mikael and I) are going to be in Nantes for CP- 
Tools and CP for the next week. We hope to see many of you there!

This will be an opportunity for discussion, e.g. if you want to get  
some first-hand information on how to do certain things in Gecode. Of  
course, we're also very interested in what you're using Gecode for!  
Show us your demos!

There will be a system overview of Gecode at CP-Tools on Sunday, and  
a demonstration of Gecode/J during the demo session on Wednesday.

See you in Nantes,

Message-ID: <20060928184539.k7fbk3y7ks4o4gkw@webmail.polimi.it>

Hi!
This is the first time I've tried to build gecode. My set-up is  
version 1.3.0 on WinXP with cygwin and Bloodshed Dev-C++.
In the source file .cpp I included "kernel.hh".
"kernel.hh" includes "memory.icc".
In "memory.icc" there is the following line:

> forceinline void*

Output reports: 'expected constructor, destructor or type conversion  
before void'  referred to the line above
Thanks
Andrea

Subject: [gecode-users] Compiling Gecode/J 1.0.0 on Windows
Message-ID: <451E9641.3090006@coli.uni-sb.de>

Hi all,

I just had some trouble compiling Gecode/J 1.0.0 under Windows, and I
thought I'd share my experiences. I'm using the free MS Visual C++
compiler (although it might an older version; this is 13.10.3077),
Cygwin, and the binary distribution of Gecode 1.3.0.

When I ran "configure", it complained that it couldn't find the packages
gecode, gecode-search, and gecode-minimodel. I didn't know how to use
the PKG_CONFIG_PATH variable, so I tried to go for setting the
Gecode_LIBS and Gecode_CFLAGS variables. Because I'm lazy, I simply
copied the contents of the "lib" and "include" directories into the
Gecode/J directory, rather than futzing around with pathnames.
I also set Gecode_CFLAGS to "-I." and Gecode_LIBS to /link /libpath:.

But the linker kept giving me error messages about unresolvable symbols
anyway. After a while I figured out that the *.lib files from the Gecode
distribution need to be included as extra input files in the cl call,
like so:

cl -I"c:/Programme/Java/jdk1.5.0/include" \
  -I"c:/Programme/Java/jdk1.5.0/include win32" -nologo -EHsc -GR -Ox \
  -LD GecodeSpace.obj Gecode_wrap.obj GecodeInt.lib GecodeKernel.lib \
  GecodeMinimodel.lib GecodeSearch.lib GecodeSet.lib -FeGecodejava.dll \
  /link "/libpath:."

(I just copy & pasted the call from the Make run for my configuration
and added the libs.)

This command runs successfully, and afterwards you can run "make" to
complete the build process.

Now while this works, it's clearly not what you guys had in mind for the
build process. Is there an easier way, and could you document it in the
compile instructions?

Cheers,
 Alexander.

Subject: [gecode-users] Bug in Utool/J, IntVar.toString?
Message-ID: <451E9AD4.9020703@cs.columbia.edu>

Hi guys,

also when I run the "Money" and "MagicSquare" examples in the Utool/J
1.0.0 distribution, the Explorer runs fine and displays a green leaf.
But when I double-click on the green leaf to display the solution, Java
crashes because of an EXCEPTION_ACCESS_VIOLATION in the C++ library.

The C++ versions of both programs run fine for me.

I have attached the error report files for both example programs. The
error seems to occur somewhere in the IntVar.toString method (or
whatever C++ function it calls).

Cheers,
 Alexander.
