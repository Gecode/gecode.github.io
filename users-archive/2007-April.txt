Subject: [gecode-users] Gecode/J arithmetic constraints
Message-ID: <1175529361.4799.54.camel@pc-dispo5>

Dear list,

I am new to constraint solving, to Gecode, and to this list, and have a
quite basic question (I guess). I am mainly interested in my Ph.D.
project in solving arithmetic constraints. I saw that Gecode offers here
beside others "plus", "minus" and "sqr".

I cannot find those in Gecode/J. Do I miss something? I want to express
a constraint like z = x + y (over finite domains).

Thanks and cheers,
Lars

Hi,

To post such a propagator, you can use the linear constraint :

linear(JavaSpace home, VarArray<? extends IntVar> array, IntRelType rel,
IntVar var)

In your case :

array is an array containing x and y

rel is IRT_EQ (for the equality)

var is z

I hope it'll help.

Cheers,

Mikael

PS : you can find the Gecode/J api here :
http://www.gecode.org/gecodej/javadoc/index.html

Hi there,

May be a  linear() constraint with coefficient [1,1] and array of [a,b]
linear (this, coeff, Array, IRT_EQ, varZ); could help.

-- There might be another way to express  (but I dont know)

Cheers,

Hi,

I have checked out the main page and previous post  but could not succeed 
much. I also found an installation pdf but it is for Gecode/J and I would 
like to go for gecode. (using Win XP)

I installed newest .msi, downloaded the archive gecode-1.3.1-bin-win32.zip, 
have visual studio 2005.

I cant manage to compile the examples neither writing my own ones.

what I try is to create win32 c++ console applications and write my own 
models (Correct me if I am wrong)
VS gives error- cant find "gecode/kernel.h" for the examples codes although 
I have them in the same folder with my cpp file. (am I doing sth completely 
irrelevant)
And any required configuration beforehand.

I am upset for these installation questions, but not good at running up 
software.

Thank you all,
robe

Dear Robe,

while I use MSVC myself for development, I only use it from the commandline,
so my tips are limited: the only thing you need to do to get the stuff up
and running is to make sure that MSVC finds the header files, if you
installed the *.msi package in the default place, it should be something
like
	"c:\Program Files\Gecode\include"

How to the Visual Studio how to use it, check its reference (it should be
found under the header VC++ Directories or something like that if my memory
serves me right).

That should be all

All the best
Christian

yes, for now this seems to be the problem:

for develeopment environment it should be adding extra folders from options

Dear all,

I have not installed Gecode in the standard place. In order to tell 
GecodeJ's configure where to find the libs I am using GECODE_LIBS.

    ./configure GECODE_LIBS=/home/luque/sources/gecode/gecode-1.3.0

However, configure is still not finding the libraries...

What exactly is the error message that you get? I think configure  
currently only checks whether pkg-config finds gecode, and if it  
doesn't, it fails. So you'll have to at least make sure that the pkg- 
config files for gecode (which are called gecode.pc, gecode-search.pc  
and gecode-minimodel.pc) are on the PKG_CONFIG_PATH. If the  
installation directory is different from what the pkg-config files  
say, you can still use GECODE_LIBS in order to specify the new location.

Cheers,
	Guido

There are two problem here: first, you have to set PKG_CONFIG_PATH to  
the place where the *.pc files are installed, and second, you have to  
install gecode somewhere first.

Typically, if you configure Gecode (not Gecode/J), you can specify  
the prefix where it is installed. Assuming you did ./configure -- 
prefix=<gecodeprefix> (with some concrete path for <gecodeprefix>)  
and then make install, you have to set the PKG_CONFIG_PATH  
environment variable to <gecodeprefix>/lib/pkgconfig. Then configure  
(in Gecode/J) should find the installed library.

Cheers,
	Guido

Hi,

sorry that I was not more detailled, but the questions are indeed not that
Gecode specific. Whatever library you want to interface to, you need to make
sure that its header files are found (which you did) but also where to find
the libraries and dlls. The libraries should be ok automatically. The
libraries *.lib (required ofr linkage) you also have to specify, they are in
the lib subdirectory of the Gecode installation.

Cheers
Christian

Thanks a lot Guido!

By the way, there is a typo in the documentation:
   
    The examples can be compiled using **make examples**

I think you mean **make javaexamples**

Message-ID: <2DD017E3E050344EA9DB3B0B1FACB44B0DB15C07@emss03m06.us.lmco.com>

I am attempting to implement an edge-finding algorithm that is similar
to that of firstsDist used in Mozart.  In order to do this, two major
events should occur for every branch:

 

- Propagation:  Generate propagators that specify that a given task will
be first.

- Accounting:   Keep track of what tasks have been ordered in some kind
of data structure.

 

I am assuming that a left branch specifies that a given task should be
first while a right branch specifies that the same task is not first.
In the case that a task is not first, the appropriate data structure
will need to be updated so that the task should not be chosen until
another task goes first.  It appears that streams are used to accomplish
this type of accounting in Mozart.

 

>From what I understand of the Gecode branching framework this is what I
can work with:

 

-status

Find if there are any tasks that need to be ordered.  At this point the
Space instance cannot be modified, but the Branching instance can be
modified in order to keep track of the tasks.

 

-description

Return some sort of identifier specifying which task should be ordered
first. The Space instance is still not modifiable here.

 

-commit

Perform the necessary propagation depending on the branching alternative
(left or right).  The Space is modifiable, but it appears that the
Branching instance should not be modified.  Is this a correct
assumption?  Depending on the branching alternative, I need to specify
that the chosen task is first or specify that the chosen task cannot be
first using a data structure for accounting purposes.

 

 

Given that information, is it OK to keep the additional data structures,
such as vectors, within the Space instance so that the ordered tasks can
be tracked?  I considered keeping this information in the Branching
instance; however this is not possible since I need to update the
accounting data within commit.  This needs to be done within commit
since that is the only place I know whether I am taking a left or right
branch and I cannot edit the branching instance according to my
assumption listed above.  So, my questions boil down to the following:

 

Is it bad to edit Branching member variables in commit?

Is it OK to edit native data structures contained in the Space instance
within commit?

Do you have any other recommendations for how I can keep track of the
ordered/unordered tasks?

 

Thanks,

Justin

Dear all,

I have installed the last versions of Gecode and GecodeJ successfully. I 
am able to run the GecodeJ examples without any problem.

I would like to use GecodeJ from Eclipse. As far as I understand, 
GecodeJ.jar is installed in my system's directory for Java extensions ( 
/usr/lib/j2sdk1.5-sun/jre/lib/ext/GecodeJ.jar), so that I can import 
Gecode/J packages without setting the class path.

However, I am getting the following error *when using Eclipse*:

=======
Gecode native code library failed to load.
java.lang.UnsatisfiedLinkError: no gecodej in java.library.path
=======

I guess the gecodej in the error is referring to the GecodeJ.jar above 
mentioned. However, I am not that familiar with Eclipse. Could you help 
me with this, please?

Thanks,
Luis

The error is not referring to GecodeJ.jar, but to libgecodej.so. It  
should be installed in the Java extension directory, too.

In fact, the error means that GecodeJ.jar has been found, so that  
path seems to be fine. It may be necessary to set the property  
java.library.path somewhere in the Eclipse settings to wherever  
the .so is installed.

Actually libgecodej.so is installed in /usr/local/lib/.

In order to set java.library.path, I did the following:

I went to Run-> Run...-> Java Applicaton-> New ->Arguments -> VM 
Arguments.  I pasted  "-Djava.library.path=/usr/local/lib/" to the VM 
Arguments field.

However, I am now getting the following problem:

Gecode native code library failed to load.
java.lang.UnsatisfiedLinkError: /usr/local/lib/libgecodej.so.1.0: 
libgecodeint.so.8: cannot open shared object file: No such file or directory

I don't understand this error...

Luis

That seems to be the way to do it.

It means that the Gecode libraries are not on the LD_LIBRARY_PATH.  
Check where they are installed, and that that path is either in /etc/ 
ld.so.conf (like /usr/lib) or in the LD_LIBRARY_PATH environment  
variable.

Actually, I had a typo in the definition of LD_LIBRARY_PATH...  
Everything is fine now!

Subject: [gecode-users] Correct ExecStatus to return from propagate?
Message-ID: <efac0bb40704070713g281f4c5n4f0585ac727c83e@mail.gmail.com>

Hi,

Im a bit confused as to when exactly i should return the various
ExecStatus from my (n-ary) propagator.

I understand that ES_FAILED means that the propagation failed, ie it
signals a dead-end, so i return that whenever i completely empty a
domain.

I also understand ES_SUBSUMED which i return when my constraint is
entailed by the domains.

However, ES_OK, ES_FIX and ES_NOFIX im not sure if i understand
correctly. If i have pruned all i can unless another propagator
removes more values (without reducing all domains to size 1 or
failing), what should i return? Also, should i return something
specific if i didnt prune any values?

Finally if all domains are reduced to size 1, should i return
ES_SUBSUMED, or something else?

On a related note, does a variable automatically switch to being
assigned when its domain is reduced to a single value?

Thanks,
Peter Tiedemann

Yes.

You never return ES_OK, it is only used for the propagator post  
functions, not for the propagate function itself. Your intuition  
about FIX and NOFIX is basically correct: If you can guarantee that  
after propagation, your propagator is at a fixpoint, i.e. running it  
immediately again will not result in any pruning, you may return  
ES_FIX. In all other cases, return ES_NOFIX. So it is always safe to  
return NOFIX, but potentially less efficient than possible.

Not pruning anything is not a special case: if you know the  
propagator is at a fixpoint, return ES_FIX, otherwise ES_NOFIX.

Christian has some slides dealing with fixpoints of propagators  
(slide 40):
http://www.ict.kth.se/courses/2G1515/notes/2G1515-L05-1.pdf

> Finally if all domains are reduced to size 1, should i return
> ES_SUBSUMED, or something else?

You should return ES_SUBSUMED. This will guarantee that the  
propagator is removed and its memory reclaimed. Our test suite, e.g.,  
checks for all propagators that they are subsumed when all variables  
are assigned.

> On a related note, does a variable automatically switch to being
> assigned when its domain is reduced to a single value?

Yes, you don't have to do anything about that. Actually, a variable  
doesn't have a flag or anything that says that its assigned - it just  
checks (in the case of integer variables) whether min=max.

Hi,

Is there some way to ensure ( or just strongly suggest) that a
propagator is scheduled to run only after the other propagators have
stabilized ( or thats its just in general pushed to the back of the
propagation queue) ?

I thought perhaps the propagation cost() function could achieve an
effect like this, if it returns a very high cost?

Related to this, how is the cost() function used exactly? I cant seem
to find any information on this in the documentation.

Hi Peter,

yes you are right: propagators with lower cost are most likely to be run
before propagators with higher cost.

The cost values basically capture some levels of constant runtime and then
some levels of asymptotic runtime. The order in which they are defined, also
describes the order in which propagators are likely to be picked for
execution.

The addendum "likely" has to do with the fact that some of the symbolic
costs (for example, PC_BINARY_LO and PC_UNARY_LO) are mapped to the same
actual cost level. For an anlysis of this, please check:
	http://web.it.kth.se/~schulte/paper.html?id=SchulteStuckey:CCoR:2006

What do you mean with how the cost function is used? Could you elaborate,
please?

Cheers
Christian

Message-ID: <000c01c77b73$d59dc2d0$acd4ed82@beule>

Hi Justin,

a rather elaborate question that took me some time... Your findings about
status and description are accurate: you cannot change the space and you
should not change the branching in a way such that it becomes observable.
Remember, const does not mean that you do not change but that a second call
will deliver the same result (think of the mutable modifier, for example as
is used for ViewValBranchings).

The findings about commit are not correct: you are absolutely free to modify
your branching! Nothing suggests otherwise. And you are right to keep it
inside the branching, anything else would be very bad and difficult (you
would have to have spaces that are special in order to use them with your
branching, so not that hot).

Please do not hesitate to ask more questions of that sort! Do you consider
to only do branching or also propagation? Because there is a very
interesting issue for edge-finding/first-last: both propagation and
branching should share the same data structures to maintain their
information for efficiency. Support for sharing state among several
propagators/branching is on our todo list for a long time but we decided to
only do it when we implement exactly what you are now appareantly trying to
do...

All the best
Christian

that of firstsDist used in Mozart.  In order to do this, two major events
should occur for every branch:
 
- Propagation:  Generate propagators that specify that a given task will be
first.
- Accounting:   Keep track of what tasks have been ordered in some kind of
data structure.
 
I am assuming that a left branch specifies that a given task should be first
while a right branch specifies that the same task is not first.  In the case
that a task is not first, the appropriate data structure will need to be
updated so that the task should not be chosen until another task goes first.
It appears that streams are used to accomplish this type of accounting in
Mozart.
 
>From what I understand of the Gecode branching framework this is what I can
work with:
 
-status
Find if there are any tasks that need to be ordered.  At this point the
Space instance cannot be modified, but the Branching instance can be
modified in order to keep track of the tasks.
 
-description
Return some sort of identifier specifying which task should be ordered
first. The Space instance is still not modifiable here.
 
-commit
Perform the necessary propagation depending on the branching alternative
(left or right).  The Space is modifiable, but it appears that the Branching
instance should not be modified.  Is this a correct assumption?  Depending
on the branching alternative, I need to specify that the chosen task is
first or specify that the chosen task cannot be first using a data structure
for accounting purposes.
 
 
Given that information, is it OK to keep the additional data structures,
such as vectors, within the Space instance so that the ordered tasks can be
tracked?  I considered keeping this information in the Branching instance;
however this is not possible since I need to update the accounting data
within commit.  This needs to be done within commit since that is the only
place I know whether I am taking a left or right branch and I cannot edit
the branching instance according to my assumption listed above.  So, my
questions boil down to the following:
 
Is it bad to edit Branching member variables in commit?
Is it OK to edit native data structures contained in the Space instance
within commit?
Do you have any other recommendations for how I can keep track of the
ordered/unordered tasks?

I was just wondering how the cost affected the ordering, but it seems
that this is explained in the reference you just gave me. From a quick
scan of it, it would seem that if i choose the highest cost (and no
other propagators do the same), then i am in fact 100% sure that my
propagator will only be asked to propagate when all other propagators
have stabilized, which is exactly the effect i was hoping for.

Thanks for the quick answer, you guys really have short response times :)

Well, you cannot rely on that no other propagator does it. At least not in
real life...

What are you trying to do? If you have a propagator composed from a cheap
and an expensive stage you might want to consider staged propagation. Just
see the paper I mentioned before. We use it regularly in Gecode to great
benefit.

Sorry i wasnt more clear. There is two aspects to this. The constraint
is pretty expensive to propagate ( this is a different constraint than
the one i send you the paper about btw, im using Gecode for two
separate projects ), for this i dont care if its placed at the very
end. That property is just something i wanted in order to tell whether
the constraint im adding is pruning values that would otherwise not be
pruned in that search node. Ie, if the other constraints have
stabilized and i then prune some values, i know these values would not
have been pruned by the other propagators unless a branching occurred.

The other constraints involved are distinct's and they hopefully dont
provide a cost of PC_CRAZY_HI :)

Regardless, this concept of staged propagation sounds interesting, i
will take a more thorough look at the paper.

Peter Tiedemann

Thanks, that information was very helpful.

As for your question, I am not implementing the edge finding in the most
efficient manner since this is my first shot at the algorithm and I just
wanted to get something working quickly.  This is the basic idea of what
I plan to do now:

Status:  
Order the resources according to slack then order the tasks on the
selected resource.  This includes trimming the list to eliminate the
tasks that can go first, which is similar to the algorithm in Mozart.

Description:
Copy the accounting data structure to the description instance.

Note that multiple calls to status and description will give the same
result until a commit is called since I am just sorting the data.

Commit:
As an example, on the first alternative I will propagate with something
like this in a loop for all of the unordered tasks:
rel(home, s->end[firstTaskIndex], IRT_LQ, s->start[unorderedTaskIndex]);

After that I will mark the task as sorted in my data structure.

>From my experience, it seems as though I will need to copy my accounting
data structure to the description instance.  Then I will need to copy
the data structure from the description to the branching instance within
commit.  Originally, I was trying to avoid the extra copying but that
seems like the right way to pass the information to the next branching
instance.  Is that correct?

Also, I have another question:
Within the branching constructor there is a variable that denotes if the
data should be shared.  Do I need to pay attention to this variable
since I am carrying around extra data for the edge finding?  Or can I
just copy the entire data structure when the copy constructor is called?

Thanks,
Justin

Hi Justin,

a rather elaborate question that took me some time... Your findings
about
status and description are accurate: you cannot change the space and you
should not change the branching in a way such that it becomes
observable.
Remember, const does not mean that you do not change but that a second
call
will deliver the same result (think of the mutable modifier, for example
as
is used for ViewValBranchings).

The findings about commit are not correct: you are absolutely free to
modify
your branching! Nothing suggests otherwise. And you are right to keep it
inside the branching, anything else would be very bad and difficult (you
would have to have spaces that are special in order to use them with
your
branching, so not that hot).

Please do not hesitate to ask more questions of that sort! Do you
consider
to only do branching or also propagation? Because there is a very
interesting issue for edge-finding/first-last: both propagation and
branching should share the same data structures to maintain their
information for efficiency. Support for sharing state among several
propagators/branching is on our todo list for a long time but we decided
to
only do it when we implement exactly what you are now appareantly trying
to
do...

All the best
Christian

Hi,
with the initial support of Gregoire Dooms, I had implemented/ 
adaptaded the following constraints on gecode 1.3.1:

GECODE_INT_EXPORT void
linear(Space* home, const Gecode::DoubleArgs& a, const IntVarArgs& x,
        IntRelType r, double c, BoolVar b,
        IntConLevel=ICL_DEF);

        IntConLevel=ICL_DEF);

GECODE_INT_EXPORT void
linear(Space* home, const Gecode::DoubleArgs& a, const BoolVarArray& x,
        IntRelType r, double c, BoolVar b,
        IntConLevel=ICL_DEF);

GECODE_INT_EXPORT void
linear(Space* home, const Gecode::DoubleArgs& a, const BoolVarArray& x,
        IntRelType r, double c,

They support as IntRelType only IRT_LQ and IRT_GQ.


I would like to integrate them with the trunk branch and send you a  
patch, but it seems there are changes in the implementation of the  
linear constraints, with new support for bool linear constraints. If  
you are interested, I can try to integrate them on the trunk, but,  
currently, the trunk does not compile... should I wait for Gecode 2.0?

Hi Stefano,

yes it is much better to wait until around April 20th. We are currently
massively restructuring and any attempt to compile the trunk is doomed ;-)

I would be curious how you did it, sounds interesting.

Dear Justin,

again: looks the right way to do. As it comes to copying between branching
and description, it might be not a bad idea to design your accounting
structures to be small enough. Also, an idea might be that you only keep
that part of the information that you need to do the actually commit,
because that's the only thing that matters.

Then, you can not use rel(...) for ordering. The reason is that the ordering
might fail and rel(...) use a mechanism for reporting that is designed for
being used in modelling and not in implementing branchings or propagators.
However it is very simple. Look into gecode/int/rel.cc. There you look for
the definition or rel. Then just rip out the part you need. It will look
something like:

	return Int::Rel::Lq<IntView>::post(home, s->..., s-> ...); 

This post function returns an ExecStatus that must be returned by the commit
function of the branching.

Then, the Boolean share argument has only significance for datastructures
that are shared among several spaces. So that is nothing you need to worry
about (it is needed for parallel or multi-threaded search).

All the best
Christian

Message-ID: <20070413182123.GA2500@bonito.cs.tu-berlin.de>


Hello to all on the list, 


I am new to Constraint Programming and GECODE, except that I took a look at
some of the examples, particularly at queens, and implemented some examples of
my own extending the Space class. 

I selected GECODE to accomplish a task within the work on my Diploma Thesis,
because of its C++ interface and good performance.
I post here the description of the problem I am  solving and some questions in the
hope that some of you might have had similar problems to solve and have hints
and recommendations for doing it better.

*Summary*

I try to represent following problem as Constraint Optimization problem:
Recovery scheduling in a 
dynamic (and heterogeneous) resources environment 
(with possible shortcoming of resources) with 
spatial and time dependencies between single jobs.

 
*Approach*

- representation
I represent a schedule as a 3 dimensional matrix of positive integers. A point
(an integer) with coordinates (j,r,t) stands for the amount of entities of
resource <r> used by job <j> at time <t>. (Actually, this is a 4D structure
...) 

- constraints
Since I didn't find commonly used or well known scheduling constraints
framework to adapt to my problem, I defined my own ones using logical
notation. In general the problem may be over-constrained, so I needed to
extend relaxable constraints by "OR TRUE".

- optimization
Of course, it is desirable to have not simply one or all solutions satisfying
the constraints, but also to specify some objective function, so that _in some
terms_ optimal solution comes out. But having relaxable constraints this
becomes a _must do_, if I see it correct.(Otherwise the trivial solution with
no satisfied constraints comes out)

- starting point
Since this is a recovery scheduling, I can assume that the schedule available
before the crash was optimal, and due to performance issues I would like to
set it as starting point for the optimization, rather than start building
solutions from scratch...




*Implementation*

- representation
3D structure of IntVars, including functions to return IntVarArray for every
tuple (j,r,1..T), (j,1..R,t), (1..J,r,t) in order to use linear(...) without
conversions. (Example: (1..J,r,t) holds the amounts of resource r used by the
jobs at time t. So I can constrain the sum of them to be less then the
capacity using linear())

- constraints
I am aware that the cumulative() constraint is pretty mighty, but I really
couldn't figure out how to use what it offers for my needs. So I did (am
doing) it combining  linear() rel() and post() (Example: for the
constraint "resource r_x is not overloaded at time t_x" the sum of the
elements of the IntVarArray  (., r_x, t_x) should be less then capacity(r_x)).
Perhaps not the most legal and efficient way?
I think cumulatives(...) does not fit for my needs also because I want to
have more fine grained control over which constrains are relaxed, and which
not. I need this in order to be able to state sth. like "IF job j_x depends on
j_y  AND j_y is not scheduled THEN drop j_x too."

- optimization
I expected that there are means to  "post" an objective functions and go relax
:o) while GECODE optimizes the solutions found. But I didn't found any. So,
what I think should  work, is to post additional constraint dealing with this in
the following way:
IF for constraint("Solution_cost < N") there are non-trivial solutions THEN 
post constraint("Solution_cost < N-1");

- starting point
I have currently no idea how this could work.


Questions:
#. Is there a way to post relaxable constraints and set priority on them?
#. Is there a better way of implementing optimization
#. (How) can I specify a "starting point" for generating solutions?

What first comes in to my mind is that;

first run your project, lets say with all constraint,
after search comes to an end you see solution == null, restart it with a 
flag to drop some constraints. this continues one after another and you 
specify the priorities.

hope that helps,

Hi all,

I am using gecodeJ latest version.

- I use Options.java class for benchmarking. The problem is runtimes depends 
on System.nanoTime() method. So, what I get is basically elapsed time for 
program of that time. Is there a way to get the actual user time which does 
not depend on load on my.

- For symettry breaking I use rel () to lex my var arrays. However I do lex 
several arrays in a sequence. Is there way (I checked the documentation, 
failed so far) to have something like lex-chaining all these arrays to get 
better propagation rather than one by one.

Dear Stanimir,

let me just take those questions which are specific to Gecode, I believe
that the more general questions relating to how to model your problem are
best asked in a more general setting (as in the constraints yahoo group or
the comp.constraints newsgroup).

 - There is no notion of relaxation built-in.
 - As it comes to starting point, just use those values you would like to
keep from your previous
   solution and try to assign them to the variables in the new model.

All the best
Christian

Hello to all on the list, 


I am new to Constraint Programming and GECODE, except that I took a look at
some of the examples, particularly at queens, and implemented some examples
of my own extending the Space class. 

I selected GECODE to accomplish a task within the work on my Diploma Thesis,
because of its C++ interface and good performance. I post here the
description of the problem I am  solving and some questions in the hope that
some of you might have had similar problems to solve and have hints and
recommendations for doing it better.

*Summary*

I try to represent following problem as Constraint Optimization problem:
Recovery scheduling in a 
dynamic (and heterogeneous) resources environment 
(with possible shortcoming of resources) with 
spatial and time dependencies between single jobs.

 
*Approach*

- representation
I represent a schedule as a 3 dimensional matrix of positive integers. A
point (an integer) with coordinates (j,r,t) stands for the amount of
entities of resource <r> used by job <j> at time <t>. (Actually, this is a
4D structure
...) 

- constraints
Since I didn't find commonly used or well known scheduling constraints
framework to adapt to my problem, I defined my own ones using logical
notation. In general the problem may be over-constrained, so I needed to
extend relaxable constraints by "OR TRUE".

- optimization
Of course, it is desirable to have not simply one or all solutions
satisfying the constraints, but also to specify some objective function, so
that _in some terms_ optimal solution comes out. But having relaxable
constraints this becomes a _must do_, if I see it correct.(Otherwise the
trivial solution with no satisfied constraints comes out)

- starting point
Since this is a recovery scheduling, I can assume that the schedule
available before the crash was optimal, and due to performance issues I
would like to set it as starting point for the optimization, rather than
start building solutions from scratch...




*Implementation*

3D structure of IntVars, including functions to return IntVarArray for every
tuple (j,r,1..T), (j,1..R,t), (1..J,r,t) in order to use linear(...) without
conversions. (Example: (1..J,r,t) holds the amounts of resource r used by
the jobs at time t. So I can constrain the sum of them to be less then the
capacity using linear())

- constraints
I am aware that the cumulative() constraint is pretty mighty, but I really
couldn't figure out how to use what it offers for my needs. So I did (am
doing) it combining  linear() rel() and post() (Example: for the constraint
"resource r_x is not overloaded at time t_x" the sum of the elements of the
IntVarArray  (., r_x, t_x) should be less then capacity(r_x)). Perhaps not
the most legal and efficient way? I think cumulatives(...) does not fit for
my needs also because I want to have more fine grained control over which
constrains are relaxed, and which not. I need this in order to be able to
state sth. like "IF job j_x depends on j_y  AND j_y is not scheduled THEN
drop j_x too."

- optimization
I expected that there are means to  "post" an objective functions and go
relax
:o) while GECODE optimizes the solutions found. But I didn't found any. So,
what I think should  work, is to post additional constraint dealing with
this in the following way: IF for constraint("Solution_cost < N") there are
non-trivial solutions THEN 
post constraint("Solution_cost < N-1");

- starting point
I have currently no idea how this could work.


Questions:
#. Is there a way to post relaxable constraints and set priority on them? #.

Hi,

no there is no lex-chain constraint in Gecode implemented currently. Any
volunteers?

I don't know about timingin Gecode/J. Maybe Guido or Mikael can help.

Message-ID: <efac0bb40704141032l94ac16cg25c35eb29e63dbab@mail.gmail.com>

I have a quick question on the use of Branch and Bound.

>From the examples Warehouses and Golomb i can see that upon finding a
solution gecode will call constrain() on further spaces in order to
trim the search space so that it only includes better solutions.

This seems to be done by for example posting a linear constraint to
enforce a better a cost on the next solution. My question is simply
this: Isnt it true that these added constraints will accumulate
instead of replacing each other ( which is possible since each should
be tighter than the previous)?

Ie, you start by adding ax < 10, then find a solution with cost 9, and
add ax < 9, but leaving the propagator for ax < 10 alive. I realize
this will only add up to at most the number of variables propagators,
but i just want to make sure i am not missing something here :)

Peter Tiedemann

There is support for optimization in Gecode, using branch&bound  
search. You have to define a function "constrain" in your Space. The  
function gets one argument, which is the so-far best solution found,  
and posts a constraint that any subsequent solution must be better,  
pretty much like the constraints you mention above. Typically, you  
use this to minimize or maximize a single variable, and post the real  
objective function (like a weighted sum or an n-ary max) as a  
constraint.

For simple examples, have a look at the photo or golomb source code.

Cheers,
	Guido

In principle, this could happen, because you can post arbitrary  
propagators in the "constrain" function.

You usually work around this problem by adding another variable (say  
"y") to your model, adding the constraint "ax < y" to your model, and  
then just adding constraints "y < 10", "y<9" and so on during branch  
and bound. These constraints are not represented as propagators, but  
just immediately shrink the variable's domain.

I think this model fits for most objective functions, but I would be  
very interested in an application where you can't avoid posting more  
and more real propagators during branch and bound.

Cheers,
	Guido

I suspected i was missing something :) I hadnt noticed that that the
examples were posting constraints on a single variable. Thank you for
clarifying this for me.

Cant help you there, the objective i am considering is a simple
weighted sum of variable values, so the above trick fits nicely.

There is no possibility that I know of in Java to get user-time.
However, if it were possible I doubt that it would be useful. On my
Windows-machine at least, user-time for a Gecode/J program does not
include time spent in native code, which naturally includes the bulk
of time spent by the program.

I would recommend that you do your experiments on a machine that is as
unloaded as possible, and that you increase the number of samples so
that you get a low enough deviation. Also, the timenogc mode can be
useful. It tries to force Java to do a garbage collection between each
run of the problem, although there is no guarantee.

Also, please remember that Gecode/J is not as fast as Gecode, the
Java-C++ conversions
layer adds quite some overhead.

Cheers,
Mikael

AFAIK "assign" means to just set the domain bounds to the same value, right?
This would help in case of not-over-constrained problem. But in general, I
must assume the problem is over-constrained. It seems  I need something like
setting preference on some value in the domain. Is something similar possible?

Cheers

My topic was actually "relaxable"... 
But I might have to deal with priorities anyway, so thanks for your
suggestion. This seems to be the better way than what I had in mind: the other
way round - add constraints if problem still solvable.

It sounds like this is exactly what I expected. I have to take a closer look
to the mentioned examples and adjust them to my problem. Thanks a lot for the

No, unfortunately, there is no such notion as preference on values.

Ok. I have to deal with this by other means.

AFAIK "assign" means to just set the domain bounds to the same value, right?
This would help in case of not-over-constrained problem. But in general, I
must assume the problem is over-constrained. It seems  I need something like
setting preference on some value in the domain. Is something similar
possible?

Please read the MSVC documents how to run it (there is a shell script that
sets all the environment variables cl needs).

Then, compilation of Gecode with MSVC is described in its documentation.

Message-ID: <efac0bb40704180300r2683bfcbif1c88c5deed96250@mail.gmail.com>

Hi,

I was wondering what the common causes were of the above error?

Im running a DFS search on an unsolvable problem, and have a global
constraint of my own design, along with some distinct constraints.

Some time into the search, i return ES_FAILED from my propagate
function(not for the first time), which is usually followed by a my
propagators copy constructor being called, followed by my Space's copy
method. However, in this case i get:
"Exception: Space::clone: Attempt to invoke operation on failed space."

just after my propagate method returns ES_FAILED.

I realize that im not providing adequate information to debug this
problem, but perhaps you could give me a hint on what could cause
this?

Regards

Hi,

When the search-procedure recomputes a node, it will not follow
exactly the same path as the first time - several branching decisions
are added at once and then a fixpoint is computed (this is called
batch recomputation). If this fails, the an error such as the one you
observed might be thrown. This is one potential cause for your
problem.

One of the key properties that Gecode uses for enabling batch
recomputation this is that propagators should be monotonic. Typical
cases where propagators are non-monotonic might be: not subscribing to
all events used, using heuristic/random propagation algorithms,
reporting ES_FIX when that is not the case, and of course general
bugs.

The first issue is rather interesting. Subscriptions using propagation
conditions can be viewed as a contract between the propagator and the
system: all propagations that are done depend only on the information
given, and when less specific events occur nothing can be done.

The third issue can be more tricky than one expects. If a variable
occurs multiply, then most usual idempotence reasonings go out the
window. Also, for bounds propagators, one must be watchful of "falling
into holes in the domains". For example, given x={1..2, 5..7}, telling
x>3 will not lead to min(x)==4 as one could expect for pure
range-reasoning.


As for finding the problem in your propagator, I would recommend for
you to use the testing-infrastructure provided in Gecode. The tests
will interleave propagation and pruning to test that the propagator
really obeys all properties that it must. A test is specified as a
pair of functions for checking if an assignment is a solution to the
constraint, and a function for posting the constraint. For an example
to modify, see gecode_directory/test/int/distinct.cc.


Hope this helps,
Mikael

Subject: [gecode-users] Reified max/min
Message-ID: <20070418170422.o3xv45ew6ccocws8@webmail3.uu.se>

Hello all!

I would like to use a reified version of the max/min functions in  
Gecode/J. As far as I can see there are none. Is this true, and if so,  
are there any "quick fix"?

One idea I had was to model it as numerous inequalities and equalities  
instead, but I guess the propagation will not be very good in that case.


Thanks in advance for any help!
/Jonathan

Clarification:

What I want to model exactly:

x_0 = min{x_i,...,x_j}
or
x_1 = min{x_k,...,x_l}
or
...
or
x_p = min{x_m,...,x_n}

My (probably pretty bad) solution would then be

((x_0 \leq x_i and ... and x_0 \leq x_j)
and
(x_0 = x_i or ... or x_0 = x_j))

or

((x_1 \leq x_k and ... and x_1 \leq x_l)
and
(x_1 = x_k or ... or x_1 = x_l))

or

...

or

((x_p \leq x_m and ... and x_p \leq x_n)
and
(x_p = x_m or ... or x_p = x_n))

Hi,

There is no reified version of min available. However you can solve
this easily by introducing an auxiliary variable.

Say that you want to express
    b <=> min(x_0,..x_n)=y
This can be modeled as follows
    min(x_0,...,x_n)=t
    b <=> t=y
where t is a otherwise unconstrained variable with an initial domain
including all possible values for x_0,...,x_n.

Hope this helps,
Mikael

If i turn off re-computation i no longer suffer this problem, so this
could very well be the source of my problem.

I think what i am working on fits nicely into the category of
heuristic propagation. The propagator in question is not generally
monotonic (ie it might detect in-feasibility on one set of domains and
neglect to spot in-feasibility of a stricter set of domains) and in
addition the result of assign, propagate, assign,propagate and
assign,assign, propagate, propagate is not guaranteed to be the same.
Propagation is however completely deterministic.

So i guess this should be the source of my problem, right?

I suppose i will just have to run without re-computation.

Thank your for explaining this. The propagator im working with is a
bit 'special' so i suppose it isn't too surprising that im
encountering this type of issue :)

I have just installed Gecode/J on Windows XP, and I am attempting to
compile

the n-Queens.java and Steiner.java examples.

I have the GecodeJ.jar file linked into the project as an external
library (as you would expect).

 

However, I am getting an error that says "Options class cannot be
resolved to a type".

I've looked through the jar file, and I can't see the Options class
listed anywhere.

 

Which package is the Options class supposed to be in?

 

Thanks,

Hi,

The Options class is in the same package as both Queens.java and
Steiner.java, i.e. the examples-package. It contains some convenience
methods for parsing arguments and running the problem.

Hi everybody,
I feel very depressed because I'm experimenting the first problems even

The msi windows installer is

1. checking the network resources when linked to a cable and exiting because
it founds no place to install
2. without network available, it is allowing the steps of installation
untill the drive selection, after which it says that there is no space
available (false) for the installation

Is this a problem me only is having?

As our mind reading capabilities are limited, what version of Gecode/J did
you download, what version of JDK have you installed? Did you read the
mailing list archives? There has been a discussion on this recently.

My version of java is (build 1.5.0_11-b03)
and I downloaded gecodej version 1.3.1 msi installer

As concerning the problem under Windows

Gecode native code library failed to load.

the problem is that I don't have any dll installed-compiled for GecodeJ, but
just for Gecode (added to the system environment variable Path)
The compilation of GecodeJ by mean of ant, builds a jar. But no dll. How can
I resolve this problem?
Thank you
Tommaso

The ant build-file is just for compiling the Java files. For compiling
Gecode/J you should use the Makefile instead. It will in turn also
invoke ant to compile the Java-files.

Hi,
I uninstalled and reinstalled Gecode/J (the last release) and when I try to run
any given example (and see gist working) I get this error:

C:\javagecode\druhy\Gist\src\examples\Options.java:16: cannot access
org.gecode.gist.Gist
bad class file: C:\Program Files\Java\jdk1.5.0_09\jre\lib\ext\GecodeJ.jar(org/gecode/gist/Gist.class)
class file has wrong version 50.0, should be 49.0
Please remove or make sure it appears in the correct subdirectory of the
classpath.
import org.gecode.gist.Gist;

I didn't touch anything in Options.java (have a new project with this class
and one example). 
If I write my own program (just with org.gecode classes) it works fine.

What can be wrong and how can I fix it?

Thank you
Mirka Placha

This is a bug in the Windows package that we only found recently.  
Apparently, stuff compiled with Java 1.6 does not run on Java 1.5,  
and our new Gecode/J packages were compiled with 1.6. You have two  
options: upgrade to Java 1.6, or wait a little while - we're  
currently building and testing new Windows installer packages that  
will work with both Java 1.5 and 1.6.

Cheers,
	Guido

But is the makefile available for compiling in windows? I tried nmake
Makefile.in and it returns an error for an illegal carachter.

Please look at the instructions for compiling Gecode/J:
http://www.gecode.org/gecodej/doc/PageComp.html

You will need a Unix toolchain for compilation. For Windows, we
require Cygwin (http://www.cygwin.com/).

Mikael

Subject: [gecode-users] Unresolved externals in Windows XP
Message-ID: <001a01c7883c$6bf174f0$0601a8c0@HindleDesktop>

Hi,

I am trying to compile Gecode programs ("all-interval.cc" and "money.cc") in Windows XP using Visual C++ Express, and I get the following unresolved externals:

public: void __thiscall Options::parse(int,char * *)
double __cdecl dev(double * const,int)

double __cdecl am(double * const,int)

I have defined all 6 gecode static libraries in my linker input - if I don't I get 38 unresolved externals, so I know I've got the libraries in the right directory path.

Has anyone managed to compile succesfully in this environment?

Many thanks,

Nick

Hi,

The functions parse, dev, and am are defined in the files
examples/support.cc and examples/timer.cc. These files must be
compiled and linked to the examples.

Cheers,
Mikael
