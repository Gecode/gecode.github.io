<PRE>Hi,

I have worked with Mozart previously, and I have helped my colleague to 
start with Gecode/J last week - and now I want to finally start using 
Gecode myself (the C++ version). Although some concepts look familiar to 
me, some do not, and reading through this mailing list archive did not 
answer all my questions.

One thing that I'm not sure about is non-deterministic programming 
constructs in scripts, like Oz's &quot;choice&quot;. I see that C++ is not going 
to help here in terms of concurrency/blocking/etc. like Oz does, so I 
think that the expressive power of scripts in Gecode is probably weaker 
than in Mozart (am I right? no offence! :-)). To be more specific, from 
what I understand, such thing as &quot;choice&quot; could be done by cutting the 
script at the points of nondeterministic statements, putting the 
deterministic parts' bodies in the appropriate functions of some 
branchings... (posting a new branching should be done in commit(), 
right?). Is this correct?

So my question for now is - do you have a suggestion on how 
non-deterministic constructs could be done in scripts, if this can be 
done at all?

Please forgive my ignorance, I just do not know what am I 
allowed/disallowed to do in respective functions of spaces and branchings.

Thanks,
Filip
