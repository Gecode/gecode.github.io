Are there any plans to introduce the some-distinct constraint
(Generalizing AllDifferent: the SomeDifferent Constraint,
Yossi Richter, Ari Freund and Yehuda Naveh) in Gecode? If I had access
to the paper I could see if I could do an attempt to implement this it
but if
there are plans or other ways to get the same semantics that would be
a waste of time.

My use case is the following:

For d subsequent periods I have 1,..,k(d) activities to assign to n
resources where k(d) <= n and there are all kinds of constraints
between activities in different periods assigned to the same resource.

Today I model this by introducing a variable x<i,j> for period i and
resource j with initial domain [1,..,n] where value v corresponds with
activity v in period d and all value greater than k(i) to be
non-activities.

On all the variables of the different resources in the same period I
post the distinct constraint such that the same activity does not get
assigned to the same resource.

This works as long as I interpret the values x<i,j> greater or equal
to k(i) identical in the subsequent constraints in the model also I
would need a customized branching strategy to only commit to one value
greater than k

I prefer to do the following:

Introduce a variable x<i,j> for period i and resource j with initial
domain [1,..,k(i) + 1 ] where value v less or equal to k(i)
corresponds with activity v in period d and value k(i) corresponds to
no activity.

Hi David,

There is no real plan to implement some-distinct. But we are happy to accept
contributions (and are willing to give prime support in return for that ;-)
). The paper should be accessible through SpringerLink:
	http://www.springerlink.com/content/n8226635404k1670/

However, I believe that some-different is not what you want to have. To me
it looks like count (or global cardinality) which is included in Gecode
(just after a quick look).

Cheers
Christian

Hi Christian ;),

you are absolutely right we can do this with the global count
constraint and I have actually found a paper which compares the two
approaches (Complete Bound Consistency for the Global Cardinality
Constraint, Irit Katriel, Sven Thiel at
http://citeseer.ist.psu.edu/721003.html ). I will remodel my problem
and see which one performs better,

thanks for the pointer and let me take this moment to let you know I
am very impressed with Gecode in performance, quality and the level of
documentation, I still have to encounter my first bug in using Gecode,

Hi,
I am getting the following error message after some time the DFS search 
starts.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
terminate called after throwing an instance of 'Gecode::SpaceFailed'
what(): Space::clone: Attempt to invoke operation on failed space
Aborted (core dumped)
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
I have written a custom propagator. For small size problems my program 
solves correctly, but when ever i have tried a bigger size problem or a 
bit complicated problem where number of backtracks are significantly 
large, I am getting the above error.

I have attached my propagator code.

Any help ????

With regards
Debdeep

Without looking at your code, there are some general reasons why this  
error may happen: http://www.gecode.org/gecode-users/2007-April/001481.html

Hi,
  I think the "batch recomputation" is the problem for me. so I have 
tried to write my own DFS search, a simple one like the following......
----------------------------------------------------
public class CustomSearch
{
    private Stack<Space> agenda;
    private Space problem;
   
    public CustomSearch (Space home)
    {
        this.problem = home;
        this.agenda = new Stack<Space>();
        agenda.push(home);
    }
   
    public Space next()
    {
        if (agenda.empty() )
            return null;
       
        Space s = agenda.pop();
       
        switch ( s.status() )
        {
            case SS_FAILED: return next();

            case SS_SOLVED: return s;

            case SS_BRANCH:
                Space copy = s.cloneSpace();
                 BranchingDesc  desc = s.description();
                 s.commit( desc, 1); agenda.push( s );
                 copy.commit(desc, 0); agenda.push( copy);
                 return next();
               

            default:  return null;
               
        }
    }
}
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------



But now I am getting the error........
--------------
Internal error in Java propagator. Exit.
---------------
nothing else.......Where is the problem?????

with regards
Debdeep

Hi David,

To quote from the doc:
	"Domain-consistent linear equations have exponential complexity, so
use with care!"

Maybe we should be even more explicit: never use it for anything that has
more than four values per variable ;-( The cost of enforcing domain
consistency is O(d^n) for n variables with maximal domain size d, where the
worst case is the average case if the linear equation has unit coefficients.


Given that the domains you are using are large and you have unit
coefficients, you are just stuck in a slow finite loop! The implementation
in Gecode is kind of na?ve, but there is little one can do given that
propagation is NP complete.

I am always tempted to remove domain-consistent linear as it is so
misleading.

Cheers
Christian

Hi Christian,

that seems to be the case, should have read more carefully, 10080^3
pretty much felt like an infinite loop,

thanks,

I'm not sure that would make so much sense. From the outside, a  
DynamicArray looks as if it's unbounded in size.  As soon as you  
access element i, the array has size at least i, but normally > i.  So  
the size wouldn't tell you anything about how many elements you  
inserted, or how many are actually intialized, for that matter.  We  
typically use DynamicArray in situations where we either know the size  
outside the array, or where we have to subclass anyway in order to  
remember how many elements are used.

Subject: [gecode-users] Online documentation of earlier Gecode versions
Message-ID: <475FD393.8060602@gmx.de>

Hi,

I am using currently an old version (1.3.0) of Gecode due to my changes 
in the kernel source.
Unfortunatly, only the newest (2.0.0) documentation is online.

Is it possible to host the documentation of the last releases of older 
versions too? e.g. 1.3.X? Or is it already available and not linked? Or 
is it not possible due to some other reasons e.g. space requirements?

This would really help me for my programming because otherwise I ve got 
to create the doxygen stuff on each machine I work on or create my own 
online version.

Thanks anyway,

Martin

Hmmm, in principle it is possible. But as we did not do that we would have
to recreate all this information.

To me it would be meaningful to keep the most up-to-date docs and software
from a major revision (1.* and 2.* so far). Would that help? Typically the
difference between x.y.z and x.y.z' are too small to warrant the effort.

Would the help?

Trying to be lazy...

Hi Christian,

about the versions.. I dont know if there is anybody out there who is 
still using 1.2.X so it is just a general thing, but weren't there many 
differences between 1.2.X and 1.3.X ? If so it may be usefull for 
further releases to leave e.g. 2.0.X on the server when you will switch 
to 2.1.0 (far in future.. :) ). But as you already said, it depends on 
the changes that lead from 2.0.X to 2.1.0 .

Looking forward for a 1.X docu! :) Thanks a lot for enabling this!

Do you mean something like:

IntViewRanges i2r(i2);
i1.inter_r(home, i2r);

where i1 and i2 are from different spaces? That's possible.

yes, that's exactly what I meant.  I wasn't sure whether that was
compatible with the space-local memory management.

On a more general level, performing "read" operations (anything that is
const) on a view or variable is independent of the space the view or
variable belongs to (the only thing not to be done is to delete the space).
Anything goes!

When performing a "write" operation (anything that is not const) one has to
use the space as argument to these operations to which the view or variable
belongs. That's all.

Thank you, Christian,

this is the sort of high level design principle that I miss most in the
current documentation.  My major problem with this existing
documentation is that it does not offer a "big picture"; and, lacking
that, gecode is a lot like "adventure" (and all you young people, keep
quiet ;-), "a maze of twisty little passages all alike", but without the
fun ('cause I don't have the time anymore, unfortunately).

Is it foolish to imagine that a L3 or M1 student (or whatever the
corresponding levels are in Sweden) could start a wiki documenting (1)
design principles, and (2) case uses?  I would be so greatful.

... if this is stupid... just ignore me

Cheers,

You are so right. I intend to write something short along that lines for the
next instance of the CP course I am teaching.

I will switch from Gecode/J to Gecode and hence it will be more rewarding to
explain Gecode.

Hi,

After space copied to two alternertives, is it possible to directly
identify which variable was assigned in "advise()" method ?

the advise() method declaration is:
	advise(Space* home, Advisor* a, const Delta* d);
One of parameter of advise() is "advisor* a", If all the advisors are
ViewAdvisor<View>, how to fetch the "view" in ViewAdvisor by using the
point "a"?

cheers,

You can down-cast a to a ViewAdvisor, and the use the member-function
view(), as in the following snippet from
gecode/int/linear/bool-int.icc:
    ...
    ViewAdvisor<VX>* a = static_cast<ViewAdvisor<VX>*>(_a);
    if (n_s == 0)
      return ES_SUBSUMED_FIX(a,home,co);
    assert(!a->view().none());
    ...

Hi Martin,

as you might have figured by now, this is not a pre-Christmas feature ;-(
There are so many more interesting things to do, in particular marking truck
loads of exams. 

I'll add it to the list of my new year resolutions!

I am having some problems with VarMaps. As you said there are two ways  
to fill a VarMap: by using put and putArray methods and by iterating  
on actor specifications. I tried the second but because of a design  
decision in the past we cannot use it.  In our design we have a class  
GenericSpace which inherits from Gecode::Space. This class has an  
attribute that contains a DynamicArray with all variables declared in  
a computation space. This array contains VarBase pointers (VarImpBase  
in the trunk version). To fill the VarMap i am using the following code:

void GenericSpace::merge(GenericSpace *src) {
   Reflection::VarMap vm;
   for (int i = 0; i < src->vars.getSize(); i++) {
	std::stringstream s;
  	s << "src-" << i;
	vm.put(src,src->vars.getVar(i),s.str().c_str());
   }
   printf("End merge operation\n");fflush(stdout);
}

getVar(i) returns a reference to the VarImpBase stored at position i  
in the array.  When building the following error appears:

/Users/ggutierrez/Work/gec/include/gecode/kernel/var-map.icc: In  
member function ?void Gecode::Reflection::VarMap::put(Gecode::Space*,  
const Var&, const Gecode::Support::Symbol&) [with Var =  
Gecode::VarImpBase]?:
/Users/ggutierrez/Work/mozart-gecode/mozart/platform/emulator/ 
GeSpace.cc:180:   instantiated from here
/Users/ggutierrez/Work/gec/include/gecode/kernel/var-map.icc:177:  
error: no type named ?View? in ?class  
Gecode::VarViewTraits<Gecode::VarImpBase>?

Note that vars does not contain integer constraint variables only it  
also contains set vars, bool vars, etc. This is why we chose to use an  
array of VarImpBase.

Any help on this is very welcome, thanks in advance.

Cheers,

You cannot use put with a VarImBase*, you always have to go through  
the actual variable.  This is like update: You cannot call update on a  
VarImpBase*, only on a Var (or View).  The reason is that we do not  
want variables to have any virtual functions.  I guess you have some  
flag indicating which VarImpBase* has which actual variable type, so  
that you can copy (update) variables.  You should use the same  
information for merge.  Cast the VarImpBase* to the corresponding  
IntVarImp* (or SetVarImp* or whatever you have), then use that to get  
an IntVar (or SetVar...), and then call vm.put with that variable.

Cheers,
	Guido

Subject: [gecode-users] Quiescence in a commit of a branching
Message-ID: <823281170712280012q6bd63bacy91984899b1bb6b84@mail.gmail.com>

I am trying to batch some decisions which have only one alternative
into one branching and have some trouble to create quiescence after a
tell in the commit method of my branching.

Is it possible to enforce quiescence  after a tell in the commit
method of my branching, I think invoking Space::propagate would do it
but this method is private.

My use case is to assign values to some variables in my problem as a
last step (branching)  but such that these assignments are not
considered steps with alternatives in the search when I search for a
better/next solution,

David
