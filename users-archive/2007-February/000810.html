<PRE>Hello,

I have exactly the same problem. I have Win XP Proffessional (German
version) with JDK 6. Installer told me to install the JDK 5. When I have
done it (I have reset the JDK_HOME variable to JDK 5 and restarted), it came
the problem with &quot;Could not access network location 1&quot;. 

I will wait for the bugfix release of Gecode/J.

Thank you

Best Regards

Vladim&#237;r Du&#353;a

All of the PC's have an english version of Windows installed.

One note-worthy thing is that some of the PC's did not initially have JDK
5.0 installed (but rather JDK 6 or just JRE 5). When JDK 5.0 is not
installed it passes Computing Space Requirements and tells me to install
JDK 5.0. When i do that, and try to run the installer again, i encounter
the described problem. In all cases i installed JDK 5.0 Update 11 as that
is whats available on Suns homepage.

I tried two more machines, both with XP SP2 (english) and encountered the
same problem on both of them.

Is the installer supposed to access the network?

</I>
Okay, i suppose i can just use the C++ version until then, though i was
looking forward to trying out Gist. Are the problems serious, or is it
some specialized/minor issues?

Regards,
Peter Tiedemann
