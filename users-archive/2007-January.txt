Subject: [gecode-users] Newbie: Cost function with squared variables
	propagation trouble
Message-ID: <459E58BC.6000007@intec.ugent.be>

Hello,

I'm using Gecode 1.2.2 on Debian sarge.

While modelling a scheduling problem I have stumbled across the following:

Let's say the decision variables of my problem are X_ijk, binary.
Let integer variables Y_i >= 0 be related to the X_ij by  Y_i = k <=>
X_ijk = 1 for some range of j, expressed by using constraints like
eq(this, Y_i, k, X_ijk); for that range of j

The cost function I want to minimize is
sum_over_i  (Y_i - Constant_i)^2

Clearly, if for some i, Constant_i < 0 the cost is at least (Y_i -
Constant_i)^2.

However, for all but the most trivial instances of my problem, the
minimal cost after initial propagation is smaller than this "intuitive"
lower bound.
I believe (but I can be wrong) that this is partly due to my feable
modelling skills: in order to implement the cost function above, I have

1. expanded each square term into a polynomial
2. introduced auxiliary variables Z_i = sqr(Y_i)
3. written the cost as a sum of Z_i and Y_i terms

Is there a more concise way to express the cost function above without
introducing explicit extra constraints stating the obvious (i.e. cost >=
intuitive lower bound for Constant_i < 0) that will nevertheless
propagate and find these "intuitive" cost bounds?
If not, can someone point me to an exmaple which would show me how to
implement my own propagator for such a cost function?

As a side note, I have also been caught by the following oddity (well
that's how it seemed to me at first).
If I want to build a MiniModel::LinExpr using the following code

LinExpr myExpr;

for (int i = 0; i < ...; i++) {
    myExpr = myExpr + some_term(i);
}

On my machine, this code fails upon the first assignment to the empty
LinExpr, and only works when explicitly initializing myExpr with the
first term and then adding the others.
Is this standard behavior?

Thx,
Pieter

Hi,

I am having a problem with referring to a VarArray when the index is not 
integers but Var.
I have VarArrays A,B,C and I need the constraint A[i] = B[c[i-1]]

I tried;

1) rel(this, A.get(i), IRT_EQ, B.get( (C.get(i-1) ) )

C.get(i-1) works fine as i is an integer. but B.get( (C.get(i-1) ) stucks as 
(C.get(i-1) returns a Var.

2) I also tried 'element' to express this constraint

Int Var x;
element(this, B, C.get(i - 1), x);
rel(this,A.get(i),IRT_EQ,x);

This does not work either.
Because, I think, element makes B[c[i-1] to get the value of x. but i need 
the reverse.

In short, I need to express A[i] = B[c[i-1]] where all A,B,C are VarArrays 
and could not succeed.

Thanks in advance!

Hi there,
I think using the element constraint is the correct choice.
Maybe the little example I attached will help you out.
At least you can use the element constraint to model

B[C[i-1]]=A[i]

and indeed the alg also does

A[i]=B[C[i-1]]

see http://www.gecode.org/gecode-doc-latest/group__TaskIntIntElement.html

> 2) I also tried 'element' to express this constraint

So this was quite right, but you can directly use

 element(this, B, C[i - 1], A[i]);

so you don't need the rel constraint.

If there are any further questions, let us know.
:-D
Cheers
Patrick

Thank you, I now see rel is useless and element is just enough. 
But one point is; we will need Var indexes inevitable when the relations 
get nested.

For example; A[i] = B [ C [A[j]] ]

1) obviously rel does not work. 
rel(this, A.get(i), IRT_EQ, B.get(C.get(A.get(j))))

2) I tried to introduce new Vars, but below did not work also. 

IntVar intermediate1= new IntVar(this,min,max);
IntVar intermediate2= new IntVar(this,min, max);

element(this, C, A.get(j), intermediate1);
element(this, B, intermediate1, intermediate2);

rel(this, A.get(i), IRT_EQ, intermediate2);

3) Any way to write this constraint?

Thanks!

The element constraint implements A[I]=V where A is a VarArray of
integer variables and I and V are integer variables. If you want your
index variable to be looked up in another variable array, then this is
another element constraint. Thus something like 2 is the correct way
to model your desired constraints.

One thing to note is that you can skip intermediate2, and directly
replace it with A.get(i). This gives the following code:

  IntVar intermediate1= new IntVar(this,min,max);
  element(this, C, A.get(j), intermediate1);
  element(this, B, intermediate1, A.get(j));

this implements B[C[A[i]]] = A[j]. The only direct reason I see that
this would not work is if min and max are wrong. Safe, unconstraining
bounds are min=0 and max=B.size().

Cheers,
Mikael

In general the arithmetic constraints reason on the bounds of the
variables. For some constraints there is also stronger propagation
available (using ICL_DOM) although this is usually very costly. For
the multiplication propagator, though, bounds propagation is the only
propagation available in Gecode.

I'm not sure what the obvious lower bound is in your example, and
where it is missing. Could you perhaps give a small example that
demonstrates the problem?

Yes, this is standard behaviour currently. The LinExpr are originally
designed for construction from expressions by overloaded operators, in
which case there is always a first term to start from.

====================================================================


The CP conference is the annual international conference on constraint
programming.   It is  concerned  with all  aspects  of computing  with
constraints,    including:     theory,    algorithms,    applications,
environments,  languages,  models  and  systems. CP  2007  includes  a
technical programme,  where presentations of  research and application
papers, as well as invited  talks and tutorials, aim at describing the
best  results and  techniques  in the  state-of-the-art of  constraint
programming.  CP 2007 will  place particular emphasis on applications,
with a special  event on the use of CP  in applications.  Moreover, CP
2007 continues  the tradition of  the CP doctoral programme,  in which
PhD students can present their work, listen to tutorials on career and
ethical issues, and  discuss their work with senior  researchers via a
mentoring scheme.  Finally, there are workshops, where researchers can
meet in an  informal setting and discuss their  most recent ideas with
their peers.

Papers are solicited from  all disciplines concerned with constraints.
Papers  describing  implementation  issues  are  strongly  encouraged.
Papers that report on successful applications of constraint technology
are also solicited.  The simplified submission process for application
papers is explained in a separate call for application papers.

Submitted  papers must  be  original and  must  not be  simultaneously
submitted  for publication in  a journal  or another  conference. This
year,  submission is done  under the  double-blind scheme  and authors
will  have the  opportunity to  respond  to reviews  before the  final
selection is  made.  Authors are  required to prepare their  papers by
following  the instructions  in the  submission page  (not  open yet).
Papers longer than 15 LNCS pages will be rejected without review.  The
proceedings will be published by Springer Verlag, in the Lecture Notes
in Computer Science series.

====================================================================



The CP conference is the annual international conference on constraint
programming.   It is  concerned  with all  aspects  of computing  with
constraints.   CP  2007   wishes  to   promote  the   presentation  of
applications  using  CP  technology.   One  of  the  ways  to  attract
application papers is this special submission scheme.

The two major  differences from the regular submission  scheme are the
following.  First,  application papers will  be reviewed by  a special
committee  of  people  with  much  experience  in the  use  of  CP  in
applications.   Second,  the  writing  of  the paper  itself  is  made
extremely simple  since it is framed  around the answers  to four main
questions (see below)  that will form the four  sections of the paper.
Examples  of  issues to  address  inside  each  section are  given  as
guidelines. It is not mandatory to answer all of them.

-------------------------------------
Title

Authors/Company

Section 1: The problem
- context, description, definition...
- size of the application (constraint part/others)?
- how important the problem is? (impact...),
   in which terms? (monetary, safety, etc.)
- what is a solution to this  problem? (decision, exemplification,
   enumeration, counting, optimisation, approximation, etc.)

Section 2. Why CP?
- what was used before? (hand made, LP...),
   why change? (didn't it work well? was it difficult to maintain?...),
   why/how did you come to CP?

Section 3. How CP?
- model, implementation,
- pure CP or hybrid? (is CP used in conjunction with some other
   problem solving technique such as LP/MIP, SAT, custom heuristic?),
   which decomposition method?

Section 4. Added value of CP?
- cost of development? / time spent developing the application?
- how long has it been into production mode (if development completed)?
- what is the feedback from user experience (if applicable)?
- was it difficult/necessary for the end-user to understand
   constraint technology?
- what is the return on investment (if applicable)?
- do you plan any new CP based development?
- what are the lessons learned from the use of CP?
-------------------------------------

Authors will  have the  opportunity to respond  to reviews  before the
final selection is made.  Authors are required to prepare their papers
by following the  instructions in the submission page  (not open yet).
Papers longer than LNCS 15 pages will be rejected without review.  The
accepted  papers  will appear  in  the  same  proceedings as  research
papers, published by Springer Verlag, in the Lecture Notes in Computer
Science series.

Hi,

I am currently trying to work out how to create a custom branching.
The examples I am looking at are BlackHoleBranch and QueenBranch.

I was wondering, if anyone else has already written custom
branchings I could possibly study as additional examples.

It would be very helpful to have a most trivial example -
maybe a re-implementation of one of the ViewValBranchings? :)

I would be grateful for any additional pointers. Should I look
into Gecode/J maybe to find further examples?

Also a pointer into to the literature that talks about batch  
recomputation
would be great, since I /think/ this is not really explained in any  
of http://www.gecode.org/publications.html?

Thanks a lot,
   Kilian

You could have a look at the file QueensJavaPropagator.java
http://www.gecode.org/gecodej/doc/QueensJavaPropagator_8java-source.html

It implements a naive branching, should be fairly easy to understand.  
The difference to a C++ branching is not too big.

That would be
Components for State Restoration in Tree Search by Chiu Wo Choi,  
Martin Henz, and Ka Boon Ng, CP 2001. This is the paper that  
introduced the concept, so don't expect the Gecode implementation to  
follow it 1:1.

Cheers,

Hi, all! I am considering interfacing Haskell with gecode, although I'm
totally unexperiened with the latter (!). Actually, I have a Mozart/Oz
background and can see the strong resemblance between the two systems, but
there are some points that are not quite clear to me. First of all, do you
think using a simple, fixed subclass of Space instantiating the copy
methods with something like this:

SimpleSpace(bool share, SimpleSpace &other): Space(share, other) { }

virtual Space* copy(bool share) {
   return new SimpleSpace(share,*this);
}

would do the job? I mean: my idea would be to create such objects and
(indirectly, from Haskell) apply propagator-imposing functions (post,
etc.) on them. Have you done anything much different for Alice?

My real doubt is: how far one can go with such a na?ve copy semantics? I
often noticed specialized versions of copy in the examples...

Thanks in advance. Cheers,

HI,

The purpose of the copy function is to allow construction of a copy, a
sort of virtual constructor.

The copy constructor for a Space needs to update it's references to
interesting variables, and construct copies of any other specific data
structures. Without updating the variables, one can not access them in
the copy.

In the Alice bindings to Gecode, all the constructed variables are
collected in variable arrays in a Space akin to your proposed
SimpleSpace, one array per variable type. The AliceML interface can
then reference variables in a specific Space (for example, a solution)
using the index into these arrays. The GeOz project (which aims to
interface Gecode with Mozart) does something similar for managing
variables.

This is probably the best way to manage variables in a simple
interface to Gecode.

The Gecode/J Java wrapper, as a contrast, uses a more complicated
scheme which allows Java Spaces to implement their own copy-method and
copy-constructor. This is probably overkill for a simple interface to
Gecode

Cheers,
Mikael

As Mikael already pointed out, the Alice interface uses exactly this  
approach.

For a Haskell interface, I'd suggest a slightly different approach,  
though. Instead of actually calling the propagator posting functions  
directly from Haskell, just create a value of some data type that  
represents the problem. Without having thought this fully through, a  
model would be a list of constraints, which in turn would be defined  
in terms of constraint variables. Of course monads might come in  
handy for creation of models.

The advantage of this setup would be that the creation of a model is  
purely functional.

The C/C++ part would then just take that abstract representation,  
create the real Gecode model, solve it, and return the solution as a  
Haskell term. I don't know how exactly the Haskell foreign function  
interface works, but I think something along these lines should be  
doable. In fact, even this operation then is purely functional.

One thing I am not so sure about is how exactly to return the  
solutions. One could make a model a pair of a list of constraints and  
a list of variables, and then make the solver return a list of  
"solution variables" that correspond to the variables of the model.

Cheers,
	Guido

Hi again,

Thanks for the advice, it works smooth now.
But one last question about the Var equalities.

suppose Var A, B and an integer array I
Let A to be the one possible values of index i where  B=I[i]

sth like;
for all indexes i
if " A equals I[i]" then "B can be assigned to i"

but I couldnot find a way to imply the equality of VAR&Intger on another 
VAR's possible values.

I kept some BoolVars for assignability but ...
I will really appreciate if you can pop up a constraint for that.

Cheers,
Penche
