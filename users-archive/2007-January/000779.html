====================================================================


The CP conference is the annual international conference on constraint
programming.   It is  concerned  with all  aspects  of computing  with
constraints,    including:     theory,    algorithms,    applications,
environments,  languages,  models  and  systems. CP  2007  includes  a
technical programme,  where presentations of  research and application
papers, as well as invited  talks and tutorials, aim at describing the
best  results and  techniques  in the  state-of-the-art of  constraint
programming.  CP 2007 will  place particular emphasis on applications,
with a special  event on the use of CP  in applications.  Moreover, CP
2007 continues  the tradition of  the CP doctoral programme,  in which
PhD students can present their work, listen to tutorials on career and
ethical issues, and  discuss their work with senior  researchers via a
mentoring scheme.  Finally, there are workshops, where researchers can
meet in an  informal setting and discuss their  most recent ideas with
their peers.

Papers are solicited from  all disciplines concerned with constraints.
Papers  describing  implementation  issues  are  strongly  encouraged.
Papers that report on successful applications of constraint technology
are also solicited.  The simplified submission process for application
papers is explained in a separate call for application papers.

Submitted  papers must  be  original and  must  not be  simultaneously
submitted  for publication in  a journal  or another  conference. This
year,  submission is done  under the  double-blind scheme  and authors
will  have the  opportunity to  respond  to reviews  before the  final
selection is  made.  Authors are  required to prepare their  papers by
following  the instructions  in the  submission page  (not  open yet).
Papers longer than 15 LNCS pages will be rejected without review.  The
proceedings will be published by Springer Verlag, in the Lecture Notes
in Computer Science series.
