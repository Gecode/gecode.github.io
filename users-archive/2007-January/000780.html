                             CP 2007
             Thirteenth International Conference on
        Principles and Practice of Constraint Programming*

                    September 23 - 27, 2007
                      Providence, RI, USA
                     <A HREF="http://www.cp2007.org/">http://www.cp2007.org/</A>
      (on behalf of the Association for Constraint Programming)

                  (co-located event: ICAPS'07)

====================================================================



The CP conference is the annual international conference on constraint
programming.   It is  concerned  with all  aspects  of computing  with
constraints.   CP  2007   wishes  to   promote  the   presentation  of
applications  using  CP  technology.   One  of  the  ways  to  attract
application papers is this special submission scheme.

The two major  differences from the regular submission  scheme are the
following.  First,  application papers will  be reviewed by  a special
committee  of  people  with  much  experience  in the  use  of  CP  in
applications.   Second,  the  writing  of  the paper  itself  is  made
extremely simple  since it is framed  around the answers  to four main
questions (see below)  that will form the four  sections of the paper.
Examples  of  issues to  address  inside  each  section are  given  as
guidelines. It is not mandatory to answer all of them.

-------------------------------------
Title

Authors/Company

Section 1: The problem
- context, description, definition...
- size of the application (constraint part/others)?
- how important the problem is? (impact...),
   in which terms? (monetary, safety, etc.)
- what is a solution to this  problem? (decision, exemplification,
   enumeration, counting, optimisation, approximation, etc.)

Section 2. Why CP?
- what was used before? (hand made, LP...),
   why change? (didn't it work well? was it difficult to maintain?...),
   why/how did you come to CP?

Section 3. How CP?
- model, implementation,
- pure CP or hybrid? (is CP used in conjunction with some other
   problem solving technique such as LP/MIP, SAT, custom heuristic?),
   which decomposition method?

Section 4. Added value of CP?
- cost of development? / time spent developing the application?
- how long has it been into production mode (if development completed)?
- what is the feedback from user experience (if applicable)?
- was it difficult/necessary for the end-user to understand
   constraint technology?
- what is the return on investment (if applicable)?
- do you plan any new CP based development?
- what are the lessons learned from the use of CP?
-------------------------------------

Authors will  have the  opportunity to respond  to reviews  before the
final selection is made.  Authors are required to prepare their papers
by following the  instructions in the submission page  (not open yet).
Papers longer than LNCS 15 pages will be rejected without review.  The
accepted  papers  will appear  in  the  same  proceedings as  research
papers, published by Springer Verlag, in the Lecture Notes in Computer
Science series.
