You can use reified constraints. Please check the documentation.

Hello All,

Especially with the recent release of a paper on the topic of pickling
within Alice I thought it might be a good idea to ask if there is already a
system implemented for pickling Gecode Spaces. So, is there? =)

Also, the extensional constraint (catalog, compatibility) constraint has
been "temporarily disabled" in the gecode-trunk since revision 4515. Could
someone provide information as to why it was disabled?

Cheers,
Michal

There will be, we're currently working on it, and it's close to being  
checked in to the trunk.

The trunk is our cutting-edge working version, and sometimes things  
are disabled because they just don't work or make other parts of the  
system crash (I don't know the particular reason for extensional  
being disabled, though).

Hi, let me just take your second question: there is really no point
discussing the trunk. We are preparing a release (after summer) that will
have extensional constraints, but in the meantime things come and go and
might be (and actually are) broken.

We've found valgrind to be extremely useful. It does not only find  
memory leaks, but also use of uninitialized memory or dangling  
pointers, and it tells you exactly where in your code the problem is.

Hi,

I've been trying to compile the contribs using the default
Makefile.contribs, but it fails if the default shell (/bin/sh/) is not
Borne-again shell (bash).

I've change the conflict line:
sed -e "s|\(dnl
@CONTRIBS@\)|AC_GECODE_ENABLE_CONTRIB($${i/*\/},\"$$DESC\",[]) \1|g" \

with this:
sed -e "s|\(dnl
@CONTRIBS@\)|AC_GECODE_ENABLE_CONTRIB($${i#*\/},\"$$DESC\",[]) \1|g" \

I'm using Ubuntu 7.04.

I only know definitely that cp(Graph) is broken in the current trunk,  
and will be removed for the next release.

Subject: [gecode-users] Installation with Intel Compiler 64 bits
Message-ID: <469F8101.5090505@polymtl.ca>

We had some problems to install Gecode on our new parallel computer 
with  Intel Compiler 64 bits which crash when compiling  the library  :

icpc -I. -I. -DNDEBUG -fPIC -ggdb -O3 -fno-strict-aliasing  -DNDEBUG 
-fPIC -ggdb
-O3 -fno-strict-aliasing   \

base class "Gecode::ActorLink" is not allowed
       t[0] = static_cast<Propagator*>(f[0]->prev());; 

which is an internal error of the compiler.  According to the c++ expert 
from Intel the program is not c++ standard conforming. 

So, to install the library we must modified the class Space as :

--- ./gecode/kernel/core.icc    2007-06-12 17:14:48.000000000 +0200

If someone have to install Gecode onto this architecture it could be 
usefull.

Actually, this is not an internal error, but a proper error in the  
code (at least icpc thinks it is).

Yes, I also noticed that recently. However, we are quite sure that  
our code is legal C++ and Intel does not implement that correctly.  
All the classes down the hierarchy (Propagator, Actor,  
ActorDeleteLink, and ActorLink) have friend declarations with the  
Variable class, where the error occurs - so the base class ActorLink  
really shouldn't be inaccessible here. Both gcc and the Microsoft C++  
compiler handle this without problems.

The minimal example that shows this problem is:

template <class X> class C;
class A {};
class B : private A { template <class X> friend class C; };
template <class X> class C { public: C(A* a) { B* b = static_cast<B*> 
(a); } };
class D { D() { C<int> c(0); } };

If you make class C a non-template class, everything works. If you  
have contact to the icpc developers, please forward this example to  
them, maybe they can explain whether we misinterpreted the C++  
standard or it's a bug in their compiler. I'm really interested what  
they say.

A slightly cleaner workaround would be to add a private function
Propagator* fromActorLink(ActorLink* a) { return  
static_cast<Propagator*>(a); }
to the Propagator class, which just does the static_cast. That way,  
you could stick with private inheritance.

Cheers,
	Guido

Message-ID: <80537a260707211727t5d217daep41c7de2b4609b968@mail.gmail.com>

Hi,

I wonder which is the objective of the update and copy methods. My question
arise, because the intermediate variables doesn't need to be update.

E.g.

class Solver : public Space {
  IntVarArray x;
 public:
  Solver() {
    IntVarArray xx(this,10,0,100);

    for (int i=0; i < 10; i++)
       post(this, xx[i] == x[i] * x[i])  // some weird relationship between
x and xx
    linear(this,xx, IRT_EQ, 10);

    branch(this,x,.....)
  }
};


In this case, there is no code for updating xx in the copy constructor, why?
what happen if I don't update x in the copy constructor?

Thanks,

That's right. You only need to copy those variables that you want to  
access in order to e.g. print a solution.
Copying works in two steps: first all propagators copy the variables  
that they depend upon, and after that the "user" variables are  
copied. That means that if no propagator depends on some variable x  
any more,  but you need x to print the solution, you have to copy x  
(in the copy function). If x is an intermediate variable and you  
don't need it for the solution, you don't have to copy it, and it  
will be automatically "garbage collected".
Note that variables are not actually copied every time you call their  
update function. Only at most one copy will be made, no matter how  
many propagators copy the variable and no matter whether you update  
it again in the copy function of your space subclass.

Cheers,
	Guido

Hi everyone.

Tomorrow (July 25), we are going to upgrade the operating system of  
our server.  The server will be down between approximately 9:00 and  
11:00 CEST.  The downtime will affect all mail and web services for

all the local network services at the PS Lab in Saarbr?cken.  We hope  
that we don't cause too much inconvenience.
