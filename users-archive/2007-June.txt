I think I've found the problem, and it was a bug in our code. It will  
be fixed in Gecode 2.0, but for the time being, you can use the patch  
attached to this mail (it's for Gecode 1.3.1). Just run

patch -p0 < gecode.patch

in the toplevel directory of Gecode 1.3.1.

I'm really curious whether this fixes your problem.

Cheers,

I tried to install Gecode on my Windows XP but i dont understand the

To quote the docs:

	Supports value (icl = ICL_VAL, default), bounds (icl = ICL_BND), and
domain-consistency (icl = ICL_DOM).

So, it is domain consistent aka generalized arc consistent.

Hello All,

I came across previous discussions on the list which explained that with
ICL_VAL the distinct propagator blocks until a variable is assigned. Once a
variable is assigned it then restricts all other variables from having that
value. Could someone explain how powerful the propagation achieved by
distinct is with ICL_DOM? 

Thanks!

Hi all,


There isn't no way to create a SetVar from a SetView, I mean SetVar class
have not constructor from a SetView. There isn't way to do this.

I'm working with gecode 1.3.1

Yes, that's a known omission, it's fixed for upcoming Gecode 2.0. If  
you need it (and are compiling the library yourself), just add

   forceinline
   SetVar::SetVar(const Set::SetView& x0) : x(x0.variable()) {}

to gecode/set/var/set.icc

and a corresponding declaration to gecode/set/var/var.icc (you may  
need to add forward declarations of class SetView as well).

Hi,

In the All-Interval series example, I cannot work out how values for the private member IntVarArray x are initialised.

According to the specification in www.CSPLib.org, this var array holds the numbers 0,1,...11 to represent the pitch-classes c, c#, d, etc.

Could someone help me understand how they are initialised in this example?

Thankyou in advance,

This is the more general version, also explained in prob007 of  
csplib. Instead of a sequence x_0,...,x_11 with domains 0..11, you  
have a sequence x_0,...,x_n with domains 0..n. Initialization of x is  
done using the initializer expression x(this, opt.size, 0, opt.size -  
1).

Both DFSSearch and BABSearch have a method "statistics". The returned  
object contains nearly all the information you require, just have a  
look at the documentation. The only thing that's missing is the depth  
of the tree. If you need that, you will have to implement your own  
search engine that keeps track of this information.

Basically, yes. You can have a look at the slides, exercises and  
sample solutions of our current course on constraint programming.  
It's available at

	http://www.ps.uni-sb.de/courses/cp-ss07/services.html

Lecture 6 and the corresponding assignment are about search.

In the released version of Gecode (1.3.1), we don't have a special  
propagator for this kind of constraint. You can, however, express  
them using the regular constraint. Your example would look like this:

REG reg = (REG(1)+REG(2)+REG(3)) | (REG(4)+REG(4)+REG(4)) | (REG(8) 
+REG(6)+REG(9));
DFA dfa = reg;
IntVarArgs xs(3);
xs[0] = x; xs[1] = y; xs[2] = z;
regular(this, xs, dfa);

However, the resulting DFAs may become big, so this may not be a good  
solution for all applications. The next version of Gecode will come  
with a specialized propagator for this constraint.

Cheers,
	Guido

This information is not available in Gecode/J. We only provide a  
limited interface for propagators through the Java binding. Even in  
the C++ version, the only information you can always get is the  
combined modification event for all variables. So you don't know  
which variable was changed, and in which way.
However, you can find that out in the propagator in linear time by  
scanning all the variables. You only need to store the old domain (or  
enough of it, depending on what events you're interested in).

Cheers,
	Guido

Hi,

i am wondering, why the usefull IdxView and its array is hidden in the 
Gecode::Set::Select namespace and is no direct member of Gecode?

I think it is very usefull elsewhere too (e.g. for problem specific 
viewselections) without using the set vars stuff. Maybe you can shift it 
somewhere else in Gecode 2.0 for a better accessment if you agree.
Just a suggestion! ;)

I am Mr. McCallum Graeme, Institutional Fund Services,Middle East and 
Africa,HSBC Bank PLC, London International Branch, On resumption of duties 
after the Christmas and New year celebration i discovered that one of my 
bank customer,Mr. JOSHUA WANG ,an Indonesia by birth , a 
consultant/contractor with the military relief Group, a charity organization 
to the United Nation( UN), was one of the victims of the TSUNAMI disaster in 
the Asia World, he has being a private resident here in London for 3 
years,made a numbered time (Fixed) Deposit, valued at ?6,500,000.00(Six 
Million, Five Hundred Thousand Great British Pounds Sterling) for twelve 
calendar months in my Branch.

As representative with contacts in the Middle east /Africa,upon the tsunami 
disaster in his home country of Indonesia, in which he was on a private 
visit to see his sick old parents, i have made personal contacts to his 
resident here in London and through some foreign mission in Indonesia, and 
has discovered that he and his entire family perished in the said natural 
disaster in his local community in Indonesia. On further investigation, it 
also discovered that he died without making a WILL (En-state) and all 
attempts to trace his next of kin was fruitless, it was discovered in the 
Late Mr. JOSHUA WANG bank papers that the only persons stated as his 
entitled next of kin is his only wife, who also died with him in the 
disaster,so presently their is no persons to declare as the next of kin to 
the said fund and as it stand now , No person will ever come forward to 
claim it. As the bank papers/documents have only his late wife's name, since 
they have no child before their sudden death. In accordance with the Banking 
Federal Laws and constitution, the money will revert to the ownership of the 
Government if nobody applies as the next of Kin to claim the funds within 
certain period.Consequently, I shall present you as a foreign partner to 
stand in as the next of kin to late Mr.JOSHUA WANG so that you and I can 
benefit from the fruits of this old man's labor and also donate certain 
portion of the fund to all victims of the Tsunami disasters through 
humanitarian Organization.

Be informed that i have in my capacity/position carefully moved this fund 
into the Vault of a Security and Finance Company here in London that have 
Branches all over Europe/America where this fund can be claim.

Upon acceptance of this proposal, We shall employ the services of a 
solicitor for the drafting of the LAST WILL &TESTAMENT of Late Mr.Joshua 
Wang and to obtain all other relevant papers in your name for the necessary 
documentation for payment approval in my bank headquarters in your favor.
I guarantee that this will be executed under legitimate arrangement that

Subject: [gecode-users] gecode 1.3.1 freezes on 64-bit machine
Message-ID: <4672A89A.5090106@informatik.uni-freiburg.de>


Hi,

I am working with gecode 1.3.1 using Cygwin on a 32-bit WinXP machine. 
Everything is fine and works.

Now I moved my source to a 64-bit single processor system with Suse 10.
Compilation works but the program hangs up.
I searched the source (because usually its my stuff that doesnt works) 
and ended in the Gecode::DFS<T>::next() function when called the first 
time after initializing the engine.
Unfortunatly it works in most cases but for some spaces it just freezes, 
not returning from the call.

So I compiled the examples and tried all of them. The Sudoku one crashes 
for gecode-1.3.1 and works for gecode-1.3.0.

Afterwards I tried the tests provided (using --enable-debug). For 
gecode-1.3.1 it crashes for some set stuff as given below. The 
gecode-1.3.0 test crashes earlier for the int.distinct.bnd propagator 
what was fixed in gecode-1.3.1 as far as I see in the changelog.

Back to my problem. I am using DFS and a normal ViewValBranching over 
all my IntVar variables. I ve got some specific binary constraints and 
my own View- and Value-selection.
Compiling with gecode-1.3.0 on the 64-bit system, everything works fine. 
So I think it's something in gecode-1.3.1 that has a problem with 
64-bit. (32-bit on a different machine works)

Hope this can help to find the bug. If you have some direct tests I 
should do if you cant reproduce anything just tell me.

Yours,

Martin

Hello.
I am new in this subject and beginning to use Gecode/J. I need to make
searches step by step to know the domains of the variables and to give
statistics as it advances the resolution of the CSP. In addition I require
to change the branching strategy during the execution. Is possible to make
this? I must make my own search engine? What things I must consider to get

It is possible to get the information during search, but it is not  
possible to change the branching strategy.

> I must make my own search engine? What things I must consider to  
> get this?

To get the information, you have to implement your own search engine  
(which is not too hard to do). For the branching, instead of changing  
the strategy, you could implement your own branching.

You can implement you own branching strategy, look the QueensJavaPropagator
java's example, here implement a custom branching, defining a branching
class, and in this branching class you can know the domain of each variable.

I presume you use Gecode/J.  Currently, the degree of a variable is  
not available in Java.  We'll add it to the interface, but you'll  
have to wait for the next release to get this.

Subject: [gecode-users] Decision Variables
Message-ID: <001801c7b63d$3ac27030$0601a8c0@HindleDesktop>

Hi,

Is it possible to define an overload on Example::run to enable values for the domain variables to be passed from command line arguments, rather than having them compiled into the example (such as in cars.cc)?

The reason for this is that I would like to observe the effects of changing the values of the domain variables on the solution, which means repeately executing the example program, and so would like to avoid re-compiling each time.

Thankyou,

Nick

Dear Nick,

sure that's possible. But if you have a look to Example::run you will see
that it does nothing really interesting, so maybe you just rip out the code
and implement your own method to setup and run your problem.

All the best

Hi Nicolas,

what do you mean by xcsp? The solver competition format? Why don't you use
something that is more accessible as an interface to Gecode: C++ (Gecode
comes with many relevant standard benchmarks), Java through Gecode/J, or

 hi Christian,

thank you for your answer.

To tell you the truth, my project? mainly consists? in? testing? the performances of various solvers and therefore recquires the use of the solver competition format xcsp, where the constraints are formulated in .xml files. As I did not intend to re-write every set of constraints for each solver, which would be both time consuming and performance altering, the only objective way of comparing the solvers was to give them the same input: the xcsp files. That's why I was wondering whether such a parser existed for Gecode.



 Cheers 

Nicolas

If you are going to write such a parser yourself, you might want to  
take advantage of the FlatZinc interface for Gecode, available from  
http://www.gecode.org/flatzinc.html. It's probably easier to write a  
converter from xcsp to FlatZinc than a complete front-end.

As soon as you have the benchmarks ready, we'd like to encourage you  
to send them to us so that we can have a look. That way, we (and you)  
can make sure that no modeling or conversion artefact renders the  
numbers you get meaningless.

Cheers,
	Guido
