I am Mr. McCallum Graeme, Institutional Fund Services,Middle East and 
Africa,HSBC Bank PLC, London International Branch, On resumption of duties 
after the Christmas and New year celebration i discovered that one of my 
bank customer,Mr. JOSHUA WANG ,an Indonesia by birth , a 
consultant/contractor with the military relief Group, a charity organization 
to the United Nation( UN), was one of the victims of the TSUNAMI disaster in 
the Asia World, he has being a private resident here in London for 3 
years,made a numbered time (Fixed) Deposit, valued at &#163;6,500,000.00(Six 
Million, Five Hundred Thousand Great British Pounds Sterling) for twelve 
calendar months in my Branch.

As representative with contacts in the Middle east /Africa,upon the tsunami 
disaster in his home country of Indonesia, in which he was on a private 
visit to see his sick old parents, i have made personal contacts to his 
resident here in London and through some foreign mission in Indonesia, and 
has discovered that he and his entire family perished in the said natural 
disaster in his local community in Indonesia. On further investigation, it 
also discovered that he died without making a WILL (En-state) and all 
attempts to trace his next of kin was fruitless, it was discovered in the 
Late Mr. JOSHUA WANG bank papers that the only persons stated as his 
entitled next of kin is his only wife, who also died with him in the 
disaster,so presently their is no persons to declare as the next of kin to 
the said fund and as it stand now , No person will ever come forward to 
claim it. As the bank papers/documents have only his late wife's name, since 
they have no child before their sudden death. In accordance with the Banking 
Federal Laws and constitution, the money will revert to the ownership of the 
Government if nobody applies as the next of Kin to claim the funds within 
certain period.Consequently, I shall present you as a foreign partner to 
stand in as the next of kin to late Mr.JOSHUA WANG so that you and I can 
benefit from the fruits of this old man's labor and also donate certain 
portion of the fund to all victims of the Tsunami disasters through 
humanitarian Organization.

Be informed that i have in my capacity/position carefully moved this fund 
into the Vault of a Security and Finance Company here in London that have 
Branches all over Europe/America where this fund can be claim.

Upon acceptance of this proposal, We shall employ the services of a 
solicitor for the drafting of the LAST WILL &amp;TESTAMENT of Late Mr.Joshua 
Wang and to obtain all other relevant papers in your name for the necessary 
documentation for payment approval in my bank headquarters in your favor.
I guarantee that this will be executed under legitimate arrangement that 
will protect you from any breach of the law as I will use my position as the 
senior Bank's personnel in the Institutional fund services, Middle East and 
Africa,HSBC BANK PLC, to secure approvals and guarantee the successful 
execution of this transaction.
Please be informed that your utmost confidentiality is required. If this 
interests you, please reply me immediately and please include your private 
phone number for voice contact and fax number so that I can provide you with 
more details and relevant documents that will help you understand the 
transaction better.
