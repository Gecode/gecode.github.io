Hi all,

I was wondering about the representation of the entailment relation in
gecode. Suppose you have a space with variables and constraints. How
can i verify if an extra constraint is already entailed by the store
(space)?. In the mozart terminology this is the difference between a
succeeded(entailed) and a succeeded(stuck) space. Of course, here we
will not take threads into account since threads does not exist in
gecode.

At implementation level, if the relation implemented by a propagator
to be posted in the space is already represented in terms of variables
domains, the propagator is not posted at all. Then counting how many
propagators are in the space before the posting of the new one and
comparing it to the number of propagators after posting it, is enough
to verify that property.

Do you agree??

The short answer is no, this will not tell you if the posted
constraint was entailed.


In general, entailment for a constraint is a co-NP complete problem,
which means that it is a property that can only be approximated for
many common constraints.

For some constraints, posting will check for entailment (e.g., Boolean
or) and for some it will not (e.g., distinct). Furthermore, some
constraints there are good entailment checks (e.g. linear
in-equations) while others don't have any good ones (most global
constraints). As a simple example, try posting a distinct-constraint
on a collection of variables with non-overlapping ranges. The
constraint is trivially entailed, but the propagator is still not
subsumed.

A more specific reason why your technique won't work (not even as an
approximation), is that a newly created propagator will (in most
cases) be scheduled for propagation. To get a correct calculation of
the number of propagators, you would need to compute the fixpoint.
When you call status() for the space, the propagator will be run,
possibly resulting in some domain-reductions and more propagators
being run. One (or more) of the other propagators could in turn be
subsumed, leading to the count returned from propagators() to look
like the constraint was entailed.


If I recall correctly, Mozart/Oz is more strict than Gecode when it
comes to detecting entailment of propagators. But I am no expert in
the Mozart system. The common theme in Gecode is to try to delay
invocation of propagators until they can propagate.

A good example of possible approaches is the not-equals constraint
between two variables. If you only want to run the propagator when it
can propagate, it should only be run when one of the variables is
assigned. If we want to get early subsumption, it should listen to all
events to see if the domains are non-overlapping.


Hope this helps,
Mikael

Hi,

well, yes and no. The difference between succeeded(entailed) and
succeeded(stuck) is easy to find: just check the number of propagators left.


The other one does not work: if you post a new propagator it might find out
that it is entailed and disappear. However, it might also propagate and some
other propagator becomes entailed. So you don't know whether the newly
posted propagator is actually entailed.

Maybe you tell us what you want to do exactly?

I am not sure if this is the right&efficient way but I handle it like that;

boolVar expression;
linear(x1,IRT_LE,x2, expression);

boolVar action;
rel(x2,IRT_EQ,x1+1, action);

boolVar t = true;
bool_imp(expression, action, t); // expr = true implies that action = t

same idea for the else part.
syntax is just for a rough idea, please check for it. hope this helps..

Hi!

I would like to create my own branching. It should assign values to the 
Var's in the order i choose.
I was always using branch(..size_max, split_min) and now I can not figure 
out how to code a different branching. if anyone have an example on it, this 
would be perfect to grasp the way to implement a new branching.

Thank you all,

It does not do anything more. The constraint implemented, called
cumulatives, is a very general constraint. To read more about the
specific prunings done, see "A New Multi-resource cumulatives
Constraint with Negative Heights" by Beldiceanu and Carlsson
(http://www.springerlink.com/content/yblp5037rxkqn2u0/).


> Could someone indicate me a paper describing the state of the art in

Bounds-consistent pruning for cumulative is NP-complete, so we must
look for weaker algorithms. Some common algorithms used are edge
finding, not-first/not-last, and energetic reasoning.

The most complete reference for scheduling constraints is probably
"Constraint-Based Scheduling" by Baptiste, Le Pape, and Nuijten
(http://www.springer.com/west/home?SGWID=4-102-22-33293925-0).

For some updates on edge-finding for cumulative constraints, see "Edge
Finding for Cumulative Scheduling" Mercier and Van Hentenryck
(http://www.cs.brown.edu/people/pvh/ef2.pdf).


Hope this helps,
Mikael

Hi,

I was searching for an 'atmost' constraint to express

#( X_i == Y_i ) <= z

whereby X = IntVarArray, Y = IntArgs (array of integers) and z is the 
integer bound for the number of matches.
Currently 'atmost' supports only the match against one single value or 
an IntVar.

Below I attached my code (derived from 'count' and the mechanisms used 
for 'distinct'), maybe this is something usefull for others too. Think 
this could be interesting for further versions of Gecode if you like it.

Have a nice weekend,

Hi everyone!

The previous Windows Installer package for Gecode 1.3.1 had some  
serious issues in the Gecode/J part (mainly with Gist), which were  
due to a wrong version being packaged. We have now created an updated  
package which hopefully resolves these problems.

So if you are using Gecode/J from the Windows Installer package,  
please download the new package from

http://www.gecode.org/download/Gecode-1.3.1.msi

You will have to uninstall the old package before installation of the  
new one.

With this update, we now also check for the new Java version 1.6.  
Gecode/J can now be used with both 1.5 and 1.6. If you encounter any  
problems with the new installer please let us know!

Cheers,
	Guido

Hi! 

I would like to keep variables in a matrix data structure. 
Array of arrays like VarArray<VarArray<IntVar>> did not work. 
My aim is to reach a cell with an unknown row_IntVar , and known column_int 

If I flatten everything in one dimensional VarArray
then to reach a cell I call; 

        element(Intvar_row * #of columns + column_int).

This multiplication and addition is just an index arithmetic but forces me to call
two linear() operations and create many redundant IntVar's for every j.

Is there an efficient way of reaching these cells, 
(may be a 2D structure that I am unaware of probably)
because this bottleneck really slows down the model. 

Regards,
serdar

Hi,

the problem is inherent in the two dimensional structure! Besides of the
performance problems you describe it will give poor propagation. 

Suppose you have an x coordinate from {1,2,3,4} and a y coordinate from
{1,2,3,4}. Then the two coordinates can denote 16 different cells, so very
little information. In that case using an element constraint for accessing
cells will offer poor propagation whatever you use to organize the data
structure!

So if possible avoid two dimensional structures with variable-variables
access.

If one of the coordinates is a constant as in your example, you should
transpose the matrix to change row and column and not use a mult constraint.

For simple uses with matrices, check the Matrix class in the Minimodel. Some
of the examples use this.

???

what is your problem?
using a branching in your space?
usually all solutions found by a search engine like DFS or BAB are 
different if you specified a branching ?!?!?

sorry, but at least for me you gave too less information to understand 
the concrete problem and to provide some suggestions.

yours,

Martin

Hi,

I guess you are using the default branching..

To find only the first solution just use DFS
to find all solutions use BAB then you are done.

But you say "solutions which are different". This sounds me like you need 
some symmettry breaking to eliminate some solutions.

Hi,

- I was using GecodeJ via ssh using a server that gecode has already been 
installed. Everything was fine until I used VarMatrix<IntVar>. Then I 
started to get "cannot find symbol symbol  : class VarMatrix" error. I dont 
know which do we need extra imports to use VarMatrix?

So I decided to install gecodeJ on my windows XP.

- I have Jdk ready and cygwin. I installed gecodeJ.msi and downloaded 
gecodej1.0.1.zip.
Under cygwin I export the path where it is installed;
export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/cygdrive/c/Program\ 
Files/Gecode/lib:$LD_LIBRARY_PATH

.  Then to javac with -cp options I cant see where should be the 
GecodeJava.jar file. It is not in gecodej1.0.1.zip neither in the installed 
Gecode folder.
.  Is there anything more I need to make gecodeJ run.
.  any comments on the error of VarMatrix.

Cheers,

Hi,

If you install Gecode via the MSI provided on our web page, then you
get the option to install Gecode/J also. Thus, you do not need to
install the gecodej-package. Note that we updated the MSI Tuesday last
week since there was a small problem with the old installer.

The Jar-file for Gecode/J (which now is called GecodeJ.jar and not
GecodeJava.jar) is installed in the extensions directory of Java,
which means that you do not need to supply a classpath since the
Jar-files in this directory are automatically loaded.

As for VarMatrix<IntVar>, it is in org.gecode, so either importing
org.gecode.* or org.gecode.VarMatrix should find it. If you still
experience problems using the class, please tell us.

Hope this helps,
Mikael

Now I got examples folder running.
But when I tried my own project it gave errors nearly for every method.

Then I noticed that examples have the statement:
public class Money extends Space {...}
whereas I have - though I dont why or the difference between:
public class Project extends Gecode {..}

when I changed from extends Gecode to extends Space erros downed to 1.

I import:
import static org.gecode.Gecode.*;
import static org.gecode.GecodeEnumConstants.*;
import org.gecode.*;

it ,somehow, yells for lex?

As in Gecode, classes should extend the Space class.

Before Gecode/J 1.0.0 the class to extend was the Gecode class. Now
this class is just a collection of static functions.

That is because there is no constraint named lex in Gecode/J. It is
simply called rel:
http://www.gecode.org/gecodej/doc/group__TaskIntIntRel.html

In Gecode the Minimodel package has some additional names for some
constraints, for example for lex. These are not in the Gecode/J
package though. Might be a good idea to add them for the next release.

Mikael

I'm looking for a method which in GecodeJ stands for the constrain e.c. 
IntVar a,b,c;
a*b == c

but I have found just methods for IntVar*int = IntVar.
Did I overlook any?

You can use the mult constraint:

	since last propagate call
Message-ID: <efac0bb40703270932j4ef09d85v98af53a61fd5492b@mail.gmail.com>

Hi,

Im trying to write an N-ary propagator that when propagating needs to
do some work for each assignment xi = a that was previously allowed
but which have now been pruned by another propagator.

As far as i can tell, Gecode doesnt maintain this information for me,
so a simple and reasonably efficient way to find this seems to
maintain a clone of the domain as it where in the previous call to
propagate,  then for each variable xi check if the domain size has
changed, and if so iterate through the old domain of xi, checking each
value for membership in the new domain for xi.

I have a added a ViewArray<IntView xOld to my propagator to be the
copy of the previous domains.

It would seem that all i have to do is to clone x in the beginning of
the very first propagate call, in the end of every propagate call and
remember to clone xOld when asked to clone the propagator. Is that
correct?

If this is the right way to handle this, what is the correct way to
clone the ViewArray x/xOld? Should i use "xOld.update(home,false,x);",
"xOld = ViewArray<IntView>(home,x);" or something else entirely?

So far my attempts have caused some strange behavior, so im guessing
that i have misunderstood something :)

I could of course just implement my own lists of previously allowed
assignments, but i would like to understand what im doing wrong.

Regards,
Peter Tiedemann

Hi,

Aaargh! Cloning appears to be tempting, indeed! You can not use cloning via
update or something like that: these routines only work during copying as
initiated by the copy function of a space where variables, propagators, etc
live in.

Currently, you will have to maintain your own copy. In Gecode 2.0, support
for being informed about removed values will be in place.

BTW: Gecode 2.0 goes steady and nicely, with already a substantial number of
improvements and new functionality. However, we will only finish after CP as
paper writing has preference for all of us.

Cheers
Christian

Subject: [gecode-users] Enumerating assignments removed by other
propagatorssince last propagate call


Hi,

Im trying to write an N-ary propagator that when propagating needs to do
some work for each assignment xi = a that was previously allowed but which
have now been pruned by another propagator.

As far as i can tell, Gecode doesnt maintain this information for me, so a
simple and reasonably efficient way to find this seems to maintain a clone
of the domain as it where in the previous call to propagate,  then for each
variable xi check if the domain size has changed, and if so iterate through
the old domain of xi, checking each value for membership in the new domain
for xi.

I have a added a ViewArray<IntView xOld to my propagator to be the copy of
the previous domains.

It would seem that all i have to do is to clone x in the beginning of the
very first propagate call, in the end of every propagate call and remember
to clone xOld when asked to clone the propagator. Is that correct?

If this is the right way to handle this, what is the correct way to clone
the ViewArray x/xOld? Should i use "xOld.update(home,false,x);", "xOld =
ViewArray<IntView>(home,x);" or something else entirely?

So far my attempts have caused some strange behavior, so im guessing that i
have misunderstood something :)

I could of course just implement my own lists of previously allowed
assignments, but i would like to understand what im doing wrong.

Regards,
Peter Tiedemann

No problem, i just felt it was 'ugly' to re-implement domains if i
could use what was already there. Thank you for clarifying it for me.

Looking forward to it, but pardon me if i dont sit back and wait for
it, as you might have guessed im also targeting CP ;)

Subject: [gecode-users] size of the search tree
Message-ID: <460BDA64.6090203@info.ucl.ac.be>

Hello,

Using Gecode, I would like to know what is the size of the search tree 
but this information is not given. If recomputation is disabled, I think 
that it can be computed as the sum of the number of clone, the number of 
fails and the number of solution found. However, when recomputation is 
activated, there is not a clone for each node of the search tree and I 
don't see how to recover the size of the tree.

Have you any solution?

Thanks a lot for your help,

Jean-No?l Monette

Hi,

why would you like to know the size of the tree? Implicitly (assuming that
all branchings are binary, which they are), the size of the tree is almost
known: the number of leaves (failures plus solutions). The only part missing
are the open nodes. 

Is it really important? It is somewhat easy to add (the only additional
information needed is the height of the tree) but for example for comparing
models, the number of failures is sufficient.

Cheers
Christian
