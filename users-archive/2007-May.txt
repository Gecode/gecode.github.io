Hi,

I've searched for a definition of value-consistency, but I don't really
find it.

What I've understood is that using the value-consistency is no more than
a constraint checking. So, there's no propagation in this case.

Saying that a constraint is value-consistent should then mean that it
exists a value for each involved variable such that the constraint is
satisfied.

Examples :
X in {1, 2, 3}
Y in {3, 4, 5}
the constraint X = Y is value-consistent.

X in {1, 2, 3}
Y in {4, 5, 6}
the constraint X = Y isn't value-consistent.

Am I right ?

Unlike bounds-consistency or domain-consistency, it's not standard  
terminology, I think.

No, it's even weaker. We haven't defined it formally, but our  
intuition for the ICL_VAL consistency level is that the constraint  
will only propagate if at least one of its variables is assigned to a  
single value. A formal definition would be something like "for all  
variables with singleton domains, there exist values in the domains  
of the other variables that are consistent with the constraint".

We can slightly modify your example:

For X in {1}, Y in {1,2,3}, X=Y is value consistent
For X in {1}, Y in {2,3}, X=Y is not value consistent

But:
For X in {1,2}, Y in {3,4}, X=Y is value consistent!

For the implementation, it usually means that the propagator  
subscribes with the PC_INT_VAL propagation condition (for int  
variables), so that it is only woken up when a variable gets  
assigned. In fact, the propagator might be even weaker, only deciding  
whether the constraint holds if /all/ its variables are assigned.  
This is actually the minimal thing a propagator has to do.

Cheers,
	Guido

The closest theoretical notion is probably forward checking.

However, it's good to remember that forward checking may be defined in
several ways for non-binary constraints [1]. The idea of only
subscribing to PC_INT_VAL events, but doing full domain consistent
propagation (which roughly corresponds to some of the suggestions in
the mentioned paper) is not a correct approach for Gecode, since this
would make the propagator non-monotonic. See the recent discussion
with Peter Tiedemann about non-monotonic propagators for some more
information [2].


Cheers,
Mikael

Hi,

there is another important aspect to add: we don't use the terms in the
strict sense, the documentation says:

The descriptions are meant to be suggestions. It is not required that a
propagator achieves full domain-consistency or full bounds-consistency. It
is more like: which level of consistency comes closest.

Cheers
Christian

Hello,

I'm trying to install Gecode/J 1.3.1 in Windows XP SP2.  I've installed JDK
6, but the Gecode MSI installer show an error "Can't find JDK 5".

Reading the mailing list I find that there are people using Gecode with Java
6, is there a problem with the MSI installer?

 i also compiled and run the test.cc file and a tree was displayed in a

Now i'd like to explore the variables in each nodes,  i mean the

and the menu displayed by right-click  doesn't include any action

That is strange. The message I get (on a system where no JDK is  
installed at all) is that "Sun JDK was not found", i.e., it doesn't  
mention version 5. Are you sure that you have the latest version of  
the MSI installer package? Sometimes browsers cache too aggressively...

If you do have the latest version, please give us some more detailed  
information. E.g., is the JDK installed in the standard location?  
Does your registry contain the key HKLM\SOFTWARE\JavaSoft\Java  
Development Kit\1.6?

> Reading the mailing list I find that there are people using Gecode

Currently, there is a problem, but only if you have JDK 5 installed  
instead of JDK 6. We are working on this and hope to provide a  
solution within the next days. Anyway, your problem appears to be the  
exact opposite.

Cheers,

The file qtgist/gist.hh defines a class Gecode::Gist::Inspector. You  
have to inherit from this class, and override the virtual function  
void inspect(Space* s). The you create an object of your new  
inspector and pass it to the explore function. The inspector is then  
registered with gist, and double-clicking a node will invoke the  
inspect function. You just have to static_cast the Space* into the  
specific type of your constraint problem, and output the variables in  
any way you like.

A simple example (not tested, but you'll get the idea):

using namespace Gecode;
class A : public Space {
public:
	IntVarArray x;
         // the rest of your code defining your constraint problem
};

class I : public Gist::Inspector {
public:
	virtual void inspect(Space* s) {
		A* a = static_cast<A*>(s);
		for (int i=0; i<a.x.size(); i++) std::cout << a.x[i] << std::endl;
	}
};

int main(void) {
	A a = new A();
	I i = new I();
	explore(a, i);
	return 0;
}

Cheers,
	Guido

Hi,

The only example using cumulatives shipped in Gecode is the
packing-example. There cumulatives is used to ensure that the squares
neither overflowl nor underflow the enclosing rectangle (by using two
complementary cumulatives: one lower bound and one upper bound).

Cheers,
Mikael

Hi,

Distinct, alldistinct, alldifferent, and alldiff are all common
synonyms for the constraint that all variables must take
distinct/different values.

In some solvers, the different names are used to refer to different
amounts of propagation. The corresponding concept in Gecode is
specifying naive, bounds, or domain consistent with the IntConLevel
argument.

Cheers,
Mikael

Hi,

While integer division and modulo is not available directly, please
remember that they can be rewritten using other constraints. If you
have two constraints
    d = a/b
    r = a%b
then these can be rewritten into the following constraint
    a = d*b + r
which can be implemented with
    t = d*b
    a = t + r

Hope this helps,
Mikael

Hi,

I am inside a propagate method of a binary propagator... :)

At some point, I know that x0 is assigned. What I would like to do is  
to filter the domain of x1 using a given predicate function.

if (x0.assigned()) {
    IntVarValues r1(x1);
    while (r1()) {
      if (!my_predicate(x0.val(), r1.val()))
        GECODE_ME_CHECK(x1.nq(home, r1.val()))
      ++r1;
    }
    return ES_SUBSUMED;

It does not seem to be a good idea however to alter the view x1 while  
iterating over it...(is it true that this should not be done/will  
cause problems?)

Hhm, could anyone give me a hint, what I could use in order to do  
this safely?

Thanks a lot,
   Kilian

As you've discovered, one should not modify a view while iterating over it.


> Hhm, could anyone give me a hint, what I could use in order to do
> this safely?

A solution that works efficiently in many cases is to store the values
to remove on a stack, and then remove them after iteration over the
view is finished. A cheap simple stack can be obtained using the
GECODE_AUTOARRAY macro and a counter of the number of values on the
stack.

This pattern is quite common, it occurs for example in distinct and regular.

Hope this helps,
Mikael

The other big advantage of this approach (apart from actually  
working) is that it will give you the right runtime! Removing a  
single value may cost linear time in the size of the domain, so your  
original approach had quadratic runtime. If you collect all values  
that are to be removed, then create an iterator for them, and use the  
iterator to do the actual removal, the overall runtime goes down to  
linear!

Another option, which you could try more easily, is to wrap your  
IntVarValues inside an Iter::Cache. The cache is filled when you  
create it, so you can safely update the domain afterwards. However,  
you should probably only use this for testing, as the problem with  
the quadratic runtime remains.

Just some additions to what Guido and Mikael said.

1. As you are in a propagator, you are talking about views - say of type
View - so you should use
   ViewValues<View> to iterate over the values.

2. The most efficient version is to create an iterator class that produces
the values you want
   to have for x1:
	- constructor: creates an iterator i for x1
	- operator(), test whether iterator is done: check whether i is done
	- operator++, move to next value:
		do 
		  ++i;
		while (i() && !my_predicate(x0.val(),i.val()));
      - value access val(): just return i.val();

3. Then turn the value iterator from above into a range iterator with
Iter::Values::ToRanges, let's call it r

4. Then tell that the values of x1 must be r:
	x1.narrow(home,r);
	Note, that this is safe: narrow has acopying semantics: it first
reads all of r (depending on x1)
	and only then updates the domain of x1.

For an example see gecode/int/element/int.icc or just grep for
Values::ToRanges

Hi,

I am inside a propagate method of a binary propagator... :)

At some point, I know that x0 is assigned. What I would like to do is  
to filter the domain of x1 using a given predicate function.

if (x0.assigned()) {
    IntVarValues r1(x1);
    while (r1()) {
      if (!my_predicate(x0.val(), r1.val()))
        GECODE_ME_CHECK(x1.nq(home, r1.val()))
      ++r1;
    }
    return ES_SUBSUMED;

It does not seem to be a good idea however to alter the view x1 while  
iterating over it...(is it true that this should not be done/will  
cause problems?)

Hhm, could anyone give me a hint, what I could use in order to do  
this safely?

Thanks a lot,
   Kilian

Hello everybody,

I've got a technical question for you.

I want to create a class with a static function that could post
propagators on a SetVar. i.e. something like


class SB {


  static void constrainSetVar(Space *home, SetVar S){

	cardinality(home, S, 1,10);
	.....
  }

};

I tried this but it seems not to work.

any idea or help ? I would - of course :) - really appreciate any help.

bye bye,

sebastien

What exactly do you mean by "does not work"? Does it crash, or do you  
simply not get the result you expect? What is the context, from where  
do you call "constrainSetVar"?

I don't get the result I expected, like variables not updated, somethong
strange...

I want to write a generic CSP with some SetVar (this is easy). But I
want an external user to be able to post constraints on these SetVar
(this is the problem). Thus my generic CSP should be able to call a
function (given by template or parameter) that will post propagators on
some SetVar.

I would also need a way to update SetVar when copying. I cannot simply
extends the class defining the generic CSP, because I have several
generic CSP that need to constraint SetVar in the same way (specified by
the user).

Thanks in advance,

Still, you need to be more detailled. What is clear, you need to follow a
structure where your variables are updated, check the examples that tell you
how to. So, whatever you do, you must inherit from a Space, maintain the
variables you want to use in that space and update your variables through
that space.

Well here is exactly what I want to do:

I have a class inheriting Space

class CSPSubset : Space{

	SetVar S;	
	IntVar C;

	CSPSubset(...) {
		
		post some constraints on S and C
	}
	
	CSPSubset(bool share, CSPSubset& csps) 
	  : Space(share,csps)
	{
		S.update(this, share, csps.S);
		C.update(this, share, csps.C);
	}

	Actor* copy(..)...


	...
};

The fact is that this CSP is only partial. I want to let an external
user to specify more constraints on S and C. Of course, I could ask the
user to extend CSPSubset, but I have several classes like CSPSubset
using SetVar S that I must constrain as the user wants. And I don't want
to ask the user to write one class extending each CSP I wrote. 

Thus what I would like, is that the user would write a class like

class SVconstrainer {

	//eventually some IntVar and SetVar
	SetVar S1, S2;

	IntVar Tmp;

	constrain( Space *home, SetVar S, IntVar C){

		// post of some propagators
		cardinality(home, S , 1 , 3);
		rel(home, S1, SRT_NEQ, S);

		weight(home, .., .., S, C);

		...
	}

	SVConstrainer (Space *home, bool share, SVconstrainer& svc){
		S1.update(home, share, svc.S1);
		S2.update(home, share, svc.S2;
		Tmp.update(home, sharfe, svc.Tmp);
	}
};

And then CSPSubset would look like as


class CSPSubset : Space{

	SetVar S;	
	IntVar C;

	SVconstrainer sv;

	CSPSubset(SVconstrainer svc) {
		
		post some constraints on S and C
	
		svc.constrain(this, S, C);

		sv = svc;
		
	}
	
	CSPSubset(bool share, CSPSubset& csps) 
	  : Space(share,csps), sv(this, share, csps.sv)
	{
		S.update(this, share, csps.S);
		C.update(this, share, csps.C);
	}

	Actor* copy(..)...


	...
};	
	
Hope this is precise enough. Because I am designing a global constraint,
I need that in order to have a nice interface with the user that will
use it.

Thanks in advance.

Cheers,

sebastien

The easiest is to design your container class such that it registers with
the CSPsubset class: then invoking update, for example, on the CSPclass
could call an appropriate member function on all registered container
classes.

But this is not really Gecode specific but rather software design.

Where are S1, S2 and Tmp initialized?

I tried to reconstruct your first example (it's attached), and it  
works allright here. The cardinality of the set variable is  
constrained by callling a static function defined in another class.  
Please have a look and let us know if this is what you were planning  
to do.

Hi all,

I have two questions that I could'nt help myself  though some time passed..

1)  This piece returns me a segmentation fault.

with an initialized matrix M(r,c), I want to have boolean operations on 
cells.

    Cells = BoolVarArray(this, r*c, 0, 1);
    Row = BoolVarArray(this, r, 0, 1);

1. for(i to r)
2.   for(j to c)

3.       current = M[i][j];

4.       if(M[i][j] > 0)

5.           bool_or(this, Row[i], Cells [current], Row [i]);

6.      else
7.           BoolVar negate = BoolVar(this, 0,1);

8.           bool_not(this, Cells [current], negate);

9.           bool_or(this, Row [i], negate, Row [i]);

simply I disjunt every cell in the rows into RowBoolArray.
But this gives me segmentation fault.

When I comment out 5,7,8,9 it terminates safely.
Is there a missing initialization in my BoolArrays or sth else may be??

2) I could not find how to use matrix under minimodel for the Slice 
operator.

declaration with

MiniModel::Matrix<IntVarArray> sub_matrix = matrix.slice(0,r,c,r',c');
rel(this, sub_matrix.row(1), IRT_EQ, sub_matrix.row(2));

error: conversion from 
`Gecode::MiniModel::Matrix<Gecode::IntVarArray>::Slice' to non-scalar type 
`Gecode::MiniModel::Matrix<Gecode::IntVarArray>' requested

Isnt a slice is again a matrix wrappered for IntVarArray ?


Thank you in advance,
Regards

penche

Message-ID: <8abc8f5a0705160857y37763251n86fb4b1e21b07ec0@mail.gmail.com>

Hi,

I'm using Gecode/J with the graphical interface Gist.  Unfortunately, for
large search spaces, Gist or Gecode/J stop every 5000 nodes (more or less)
and I would like to let it run for larger periods of time (and space).

I tried using the Options class parameters -fails and -time but it didn's
change anything.  I even rewrote the FailStop class that is provided with
the examples so that the method stop always return false but, once again,
without any differences in Gecode/Gist behavior.

What am I doing wrong?

Best regards,

Ant?nio Leit?o.

The cutoff value for how many nodes to visit in Gist can be changed
under preferences in the file menu-

You might want to consider if you really want to explore a large
search-space with Gist, it is not what it is designed to do.. Using
just Gecode/J will be much more efficient, and of course using Gecode
directly is even more efficient.

upps! I have just found what is wrong with Q1. Sorry for that.
Nevermind, its off-gecode.

Hi,

and thanks to everyone for your very helpful answers. I can see a way  
now, how to do it efficiently. I must admit that in the meantime, I  
had installed a workaround that is correct, too, but so inefficient  
that I would never show you...
I will write some tests first and then... ;-)

I just wanted to add, why I am doing this...
Actually,
!my_predicate(x0.val(),i.val())
would look like
!(*callback)(x0.val(), i.val())),
so this is my first attempt to be able to write a very simple  
propagator in Lisp.

Cheers,
   Kilian

The contribs are currently out of sync with the trunk. Gr?goire or  
St?phane, do you know which is the last version that compiled with  
the contribs?

I hope we can get everything working again for the next major release.

Cheers,

Dear S?bastien,

ArgArrays are just meant to pass arguments, nothing more, nothing less. They
are very bad as data structures to be stored inside other data structures,
they are just good when being created automatically: they allocate a huge
chunk of memory on the runtime stack to speed up argument passing (avoiding
malloc).

Otherwise they are useless, and they ought to be that.

The best thing you can do is use to some other array data structure for
storing your variables and then create a VarArgArray when needed from
scratch (and do not store it anywhere!).

Cheers
Christian

To complement Christian's email, the appropriate data structure for  
storing variables is probably an IntVarArray here. In the next  
version of Gecode, these will allow dynamic resizing. If you want to  
use that now, I could send you a patch, it's just one file that has  
changed.

Hi,

The error as reported seems to be an internal error in the Intel
compiler, and should probably be reported to Intel.

We do not have access to the Intel compiler, so the only testing with
it that we have done was with the free trial version. We regularly
test compilation with gcc and the microsoft compiler.

Cheers,
Mikael

Dear Simon,

that's tough luck! But we can't help you here as we only can fix bugs in
Gecode ;-)

You need to get in touch with your compiler vendor as this is not a Gecode
bug but an internal error in the Intel C++ compiler (as the message says).

Subject: [gecode-users] Posting branching later...
Message-ID: <1180342688.3335.3.camel@localhost.localdomain>

	Hello,

usually we post branchings in the constructor of our Space, in the
beginning.

However I would be interested in posting a branching later (once we have
already begun the search). is it possible to post a branching inside a
commit function of another branching ? If the answer is positive, the
new branching will be posted only for the children of the current space
or also for all ancestors and brothers (ie all other future spaces).

Thank you for your answers. 

Bye bye,

Yes, that's no problem. We haven't tested that particular scenario  
yet, though.

Spaces don't have any reference to their ancestors or brothers. The  
new branching will only take effect for spaces created by cloning the  
one where it was posted - i.e. its children in the search tree. If  
that's what you want, it should work.

If you want the branching to take effect everywhere, you'll have to  
put that logic into the search engine such that the engine takes care  
of posting the branching in all the open search nodes. It would be  
similar to branch-and-bound search, just that instead of constraints,  
you add more branchings.

Cheers,
	Guido

Subject: [gecode-users] order in calls to status and commit...
Message-ID: <1180353716.3335.11.camel@localhost.localdomain>

	Hello,

I have one question related to the one I posted before (thank you for
the fast reply :) ).

Could you tell me what is exactly the order in which the functions
status and commit are called ? 

For me it should be

call to status with space S. if it returns true, then copy S. let's call
the copy Sc. Then call commit() with S and a=0. when we will have
backtracked, commit will be called with Sc and a=1.

I ask this question because I post a branching in the commit function of
another branching. Then I catch the following exception:

terminate called after throwing an instance of
'Gecode::SpaceNoBranching'
  what():  Space::commit: Attempt to commit with no branching

I don't understand exactly the problem nor its solution. Could you bring
me any help ?

Thanks a lot,

sebastien

I presume you mean status and commit of a branching, right?

In principle, this is how it works. Our search engines however use  
recomputation, so they don't actually make a copy everytime, but  
sometimes use a copy that is higher up in the search tree and  
recompute the needed space from there.

The exact protocol is:

  * When you call Space::status, after computing a fixpoint of the  
propagators, the space calls the status method of the installed  
branchings to find the first branching that returns true. If there is  
none, the status is SS_SOLVED, otherwise it's SS_BRANCH.
  * When you call Space::description, the space asks the branching  
that returned true for a description and returns it
  * When you call commit, the space tries to find the branching that  
matches the description, and calls its commit method.

This means that in the commit step, the space didn't find a branching  
that matched the branching description. This could either mean that  
the branching description is bogus, or that your branching really  
hasn't been installed yet.

Are you using the standard, built-in search engines? If yes, please  
check if the problem still persists with c_d=1 and a_d=100000 as  
parameters passed to e.g. DFS (switching off recomputation). If the  
problem goes away using these options, there's either something wrong  
in our Space::commit logic, or in the way you create and use  
BranchingDescs.

Cheers,
	Guido

ok. so the problem would be that I post a Branching B1 and then return a
description d1 for that branching. Then when the recomputation occurs,
the branching B1 is not found and Gecode has no idea what to do with d1.
I verified that but it seems that I post a branching B2 again during
recomputation. This is the same branching as B1 (ie the same class) but
is not a direct copy from B1. I use the general constructor (ie the one
we use when defining CSP's). 

Could that be the problem ? Should B1 and B2 be two copies of a comman
instance of the branching ? I know descriptions and branchings use id's.
could it be the problem ?

yes. the problem disappears when disabling recomputation.

Hm, it shouldn't be the problem. If the branchings are always created  
in the same order, the ids will be the same. Could you verify this?  
Just print the id in the Branching constructor, and check that it's  
the same no matter whether you use recomputation or not.

The one thing we do not support is creating a branching in a  
propagator. This won't work because propagation order can be  
different during recomputation, so the creation order of the  
branchings would be different and the ids would not match.

Cheers,
	Guido

I found a related problem that seems annoying. 

I have one main branching, let's say BrSF. In the commit function of
BrSF, I sometimes post another branching, say BrCl.

I printed id's of these branching and it happens that an instance of
BrSF has the same id as BrCl. I'm not using recomputation: c_d = 1, a_d
= 10000.

The problem then is that the search engine calls the commit function of
the BrSF with a description returned by an instance of BrCL. and this is
very annoying :). It is perhaps this same problem that leads to the
NoBranching exception when using recomputation.

any idea ? It would be very useful for me. Thank you.

I also post some propagators inside the commit function. Is it ok ? I am
sure these propagators cannot fail when posting. 

When I post propagators *and* branching in the same commit, I have the
problem I described before.

When I post branching *xor* propagators, the branching posted clones
forever at some point.

When I don't put any propagators inside commit, but in the constructor
of my space, the problem seems to disappear, but I am not sure.

Thanks for any help,

bye bye,

No yet, but actually in the making...

The best you can do is to take the source code of a simple propagator as a
starting point, it is not that hard.

Hi,

I am not so sure that creating branchings in the commit function of another
branching actually works. As Guido said, we never anticipated this scenario.
As I have some more time at the end of the week, I'll have a look.

Can you send as a very small program that shows the problem?

Also, which search engine did you use? DFS or BAB?

How did you post the branchings? Via the post function or by using the
constructor? If the constructor, I hope you did not use the constructor
reserved for cloning.

Also, there might be a completely different way how to use multiple
branchings that create each other: have a single "master" branching that
controls the other branchings. But that would require quite some heavy
setup.

Cheers
Christian

the version I have now is not that small. I will try to write some

BAB.

I use the post function.

yes. That's right. 

I have another question: posting propagators in the commit function of
one Branching is acceptable ? The fact is that I would like to delay a
heavy propagator taht does not do a lot of pruning high in the search
tree, but is very useful down in the tree.

This is definitely a problem. The same id for different branchings  
may only occur on different branches of the search tree, but not on  
the same branch! Are the BrSF also created dynamically? Do you, by  
any chance, create a branching in the commit-function you use for  
branch-and-bound?

Anyway, I'm sure the problem with the ids is also the reason for the  
original problem. Please try to find out why two different branchings  
get the same id.

Cheers,
	Guido

I don't understand this question. I am using a "constrain" function in
my Space to use Branch-and-Bound. What do mean by that ?

Could you please explain why this cannot be done by the propagator 
itself? I think that the propagator can decide whether doing the 
expensive pruning or not based on the the current domains of the variables.

Yes, that's correct.

First, posting propagators in commit is okay, no problem.

Second, check "staged propagation" in the following paper:
	http://web.it.kth.se/~schulte/paper.html?id=SchulteStuckey:CCoR:2006
Maybe this could be interesting (staging is used extensively in Gecode).

I think we really need to have a program fragment. I just discussed with
Guido on the phone, from our understanding getti9ng the same id twice is
impossible ;-) As it is not we really have to see what you do.

Greetings
I tried to install Gecode on my Windows XP but i dont understand the
gecode's tutorial. I'm a begginer and i like an explanation a little more
exhaustive, if outside possible. I do not understand like compiling Gecode
and GecodeJ with a same compiler, and either all the referring one to the
configuration files.

PD: excuse the english, i'm a begginer too :)

Message-ID: <4eff48ac0705311303n553c77dcwda29d90bc24c32ac@mail.gmail.com>

Hello All,

I came across previous discussions on the list which explained that with
ICL_VAL the distinct propagator blocks until a variable is assigned. Once a
variable is assigned it then restricts all other variables from having that
value. Could someone explain how powerful the propagation achieved by
distinct is with ICL_DOM?

Thanks!
Michal

distinct with ICL_DOM achieves domain consistency, i.e. after  
propagation, for each value in each variable's domain, you find  
values in all the other variables domain such that they are all  
distinct.
