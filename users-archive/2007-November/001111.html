Exactly.

Currently, you can't.  We're working on some debugging support, but  
it's not something you should expect to see in the near future, sorry.

&gt;<i> Ultimately, it would be nice to be able to attach a Java StackTrace

</I>
Sounds useful!  One of the problems I see is that often there's a  
difference between the constraints you post and the propagators that  
are actually installed in the space.  E.g., one constraint could be  
implemented by a number of propagators, or a propagator rewrites  
itself into a number of simpler propagators.  These are the typical  
issues a debugger would have to address.

Cheers,
	Guido
