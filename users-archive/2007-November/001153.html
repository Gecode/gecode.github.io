Really? I wouldn't have thought that there were so many. But then  
I've never written an engine.

I would have thought the issue was really of critical importance to  
making CSPs a really useful programming paradigm. Of course, as an  
academic researcher myself, I realise that there are things that are  
on your research program and things that are not.

&gt;<i> But you have been using Gist, haven't you? That helps quite a lot to
</I>&gt;<i> understand where search goes wrong in my opinion.
</I>
I haven't got into that yet. Is there any documentation or examples?

&gt;<i> PS: Was it intentional to have this in private? If not, could you  
</I>&gt;<i> forward
</I>&gt;<i> the message if you agree to that? Thanks.
</I>
No, but I think the list has the reply-to-poster flag checked, and I  
don't always remember to CC the list.
