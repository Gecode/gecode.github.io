I see. Yes, that is a lot.

&gt;<i> So that's quite something. And most of the propagator executions  
</I>&gt;<i> are not
</I>&gt;<i> really interesting. While debugging is difficult, and there is  
</I>&gt;<i> little known
</I>&gt;<i> how to do it, the level of abstraction of looking at a single

</I>&gt;<i> not really feasible.
</I>
Clearly not. But neither do you want to inspect all the machine  
operations in a standard program. Some abstraction is necessary. The  
S-boxes idea is a good start. Grouping the variables into meaningful  
structures (i.e. objects) could also help. And then you have causal  
relations between propagator executions, don't you? Ie, propagator X  
fired, constraining variable V, which in turn caused propagator Y to  
fire. If you could visualise the causation graph at a level of  
abstraction, you'd have the beginnings of a useful tool.

&gt;<i> Typically there is a pretty close mapping between a constraint and the
</I>&gt;<i> propagator implementing the constraint. But not always and  
</I>&gt;<i> typically not
</I>&gt;<i> after some propagations (propagators typically rewrite themselves).
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Gecode 2.0 comes with a reflection layer that in principle allows  
</I>&gt;<i> you to get
</I>&gt;<i> to know everything about a space, but I do not know whether this  
</I>&gt;<i> will be
</I>&gt;<i> available in Gecode/J. Also, I would doubt that the amount of  
</I>&gt;<i> information is
</I>&gt;<i> useful.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> But what helps a lot is using Gist as said. It will at least tell  
</I>&gt;<i> you the
</I>&gt;<i> results of propagation before branching. Just printing before and  
</I>&gt;<i> after
</I>&gt;<i> propagation is also not too bad.
</I>
Gist is great for visualising the search, but as you say, there are  
many constraint propagation steps between one search step and the next.

&gt;<i> Sorry that I cannot be more helpful than that.
</I>
That's okay. I appreciate that it is not a solved problem. I'm just  
throwing around some ideas. Maybe I'll try them out myself, if I find  
time.
