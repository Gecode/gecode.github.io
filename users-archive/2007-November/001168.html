What causes a propagator to do some propagation might not be so simple
as you describe. Typically, a propagator will have many variables it
subscribes to, and several of them might be modified. Furthermore, the
variables might be modified by different propagators, or a variable
might be modified several times by a single propagator (due to
priorities).

Even harder, even if there is only a single modification to a variable
x that makes propagator P run, it might not be the only relevant
modification for the result of the propagation of P. Here is a small
example of this.


Variables: x={1,2,3,4}, y={1,2,3,4}
Propagators: P1 (x!=3), P2 (y&gt;=3), and P3 (y==x)
P1 and P2 are currently scheduled for execution, but P3 is not.
Furthermore, P3 is a bounds-consistent equality propagator (thus it
only reasons on the bounds of variables).

In the first step, P1 runs. This gives the domains x={1,2,4},
y={1,2,3,4}. Nothing changes in the bounds of x and y, which means
that P3 is not going to be scheduled.

In the second step, P2 runs. This gives the domains x={1,2,4},
y={3,4}, and P3 is scheduled for propagation (the bounds of y has
changed).

In the third step, P3 runs giving the domains x={4}, y={4}.

The removal of 3 from the domain of y by propagator P3 is not &quot;caused&quot;
by P2 in some sense, even though this is the only propagator that made
modifications that made P3 runnable. Instead it is caused by the
modifications done by P1, which -at the time they were done- were not
relevant to P3.


I hope this explains the complexity of causation a little more.

Cheers,
Mikael
