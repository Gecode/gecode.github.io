I am dealing with collections of variables which represent a variable- 
length plan. So there is a &quot;length&quot; variable and a collection of  
&quot;element&quot; variables. The element variables beyond the length value  
have no significance. I do not wish to waste time choosing bindings  
for them. So essentially my Branching just looks at elements 0  
through length.min() - 1.

Having determined this set, I then want to choose one variable and  
assign it a value. I would like to experiment with a range of ways of  
choosing this variable and value, including all the standard ways. In  
would be easier if I could use an existing implementation to do this.

I hope so. My problem is more naturally structured as a collection of  
lists. Representing a variable choice as a single integer involves a  
rather arbitrary encoding.

What is the timeframe for Gecode/J 2.0.0?

&gt;<i> Note that there is a bug in Gecode 1.3.1 that forces you to post all

</I>
I don't understand. What would the alternative be? Can you have  
nested spaces? How?
