</I>Thanks!

The thing is that the cloning of actors is (my guess) done in 
Space::Space. So say that I have derived my own space class Space2. My 
actors are passed, during cloning, a pointer to the new clone of Space2, 
but since the cloning of the actors is done in Space::Space, the Space2 
object is not fully initialized yet and I can not static_cast it to 
Space2 there.

Note that in the Space2::Space2() constructor (when creating the root 
space), I can make sure that the needed parts of Space2 are already 
constructed before posting the actor. So it came as a surprise to me 
that I got a runtime error in cloning, because things worked just fine 
for the root space. The space I saw being passed to the actor looked 
invalid, and it was not immediately obvious what was happening.

One way that I think this could be handled is cloning in 2 steps: first 
create a copy of the space, then re-create the actors. Since, from the 
user's point of view, a space does not have explicit access to its 
actors (yet :-)), I don't see how this could be a problem (maybe just 
that it should be explicitly prohibited to create actors during 
cloning). The only thing is, who and how would trigger the cloning of 
the actors. Maybe Space::clone() could be &quot;protected&quot; and renamed to 
&quot;getClone&quot;, and there could be a public non-virtual

Space* Space::clone() const {
  Space *pClone=getClone();
  pClone-&gt;copyActorsFrom(this);
  return pClone;
}

That's many maybes :-) Just wanted to explain what problems I am facing. 
But there are workarounds, so nothing serious.

Otherwise, the library works extremely well, bravo!

Cheers,
Filip
