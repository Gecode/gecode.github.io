<PRE>Hmmm, actually the copying is already a two stage process (and a extremly
delicate one). One of the key invariants in the process is that no new
actors (actually, no new anything) can be created during cloning!

It is already now the case that when the constructor Space::Space is
finished, the space is not yet fully initialized, however all data
structures in the newly created space can be inspected (with const member
functions). When moving things around the way you suggest that would not
work an&#253; longer. Some const member functions would be not allowed (as they
just would segfault). I really would like to keep this invariant: everything
can be inspected but nothing can be changed. Even though this only matters
for constructors.

So, the idea to store the data in the space does not look that good after
all. We kind of know what to do but as we have no example we could use to
shape the right abstractions I don't know what to do. If you yourself want
to experiment, we could tell you how to massage the code for copying to hack
around.

</I>Thanks!

The thing is that the cloning of actors is (my guess) done in 
Space::Space. So say that I have derived my own space class Space2. My 
actors are passed, during cloning, a pointer to the new clone of Space2, 
but since the cloning of the actors is done in Space::Space, the Space2 
object is not fully initialized yet and I can not static_cast it to 
Space2 there.

Note that in the Space2::Space2() constructor (when creating the root 
space), I can make sure that the needed parts of Space2 are already 
constructed before posting the actor. So it came as a surprise to me 
that I got a runtime error in cloning, because things worked just fine 
for the root space. The space I saw being passed to the actor looked 
invalid, and it was not immediately obvious what was happening.

One way that I think this could be handled is cloning in 2 steps: first 
create a copy of the space, then re-create the actors. Since, from the 
user's point of view, a space does not have explicit access to its 
actors (yet :-)), I don't see how this could be a problem (maybe just 
that it should be explicitly prohibited to create actors during 
cloning). The only thing is, who and how would trigger the cloning of 
the actors. Maybe Space::clone() could be &quot;protected&quot; and renamed to 
&quot;getClone&quot;, and there could be a public non-virtual

Space* Space::clone() const {
  Space *pClone=getClone();
  pClone-&gt;copyActorsFrom(this);
  return pClone;
}

That's many maybes :-) Just wanted to explain what problems I am facing. 
But there are workarounds, so nothing serious.

Otherwise, the library works extremely well, bravo!

Cheers,
Filip
