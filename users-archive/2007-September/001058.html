<PRE>Well, as I said, there were too many maybes in my suggestion, and I 
should have looked at the code before suggesting anything in the first 
place. The last thing I'd want is breaking invariants.

Accessing space's data from an actor works fine, one just must avoid 
accessing it during cloning. This implies that sometimes you need to 
have a pointer instead of a reference to the data (you can initialize 
the pointer later, but you can't do the same with a reference). This is 
no performance killer, either (one more &quot;if&quot;...). Maybe put a note to 
Actor::copy docs stating that the space being passed to it is in fact 
just a space embryo.

Cheers,
Filip

&gt;<i> Hmmm, actually the copying is already a two stage process (and a extremly
</I>&gt;<i> delicate one). One of the key invariants in the process is that no new
</I>&gt;<i> actors (actually, no new anything) can be created during cloning!
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> It is already now the case that when the constructor Space::Space is
</I>&gt;<i> finished, the space is not yet fully initialized, however all data
</I>&gt;<i> structures in the newly created space can be inspected (with const member
</I>&gt;<i> functions). When moving things around the way you suggest that would not
</I>&gt;<i> work an&#253; longer. Some const member functions would be not allowed (as they
</I>&gt;<i> just would segfault). I really would like to keep this invariant: everything
</I>&gt;<i> can be inspected but nothing can be changed. Even though this only matters
</I>&gt;<i> for constructors.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> So, the idea to store the data in the space does not look that good after
</I>&gt;<i> all. We kind of know what to do but as we have no example we could use to
</I>&gt;<i> shape the right abstractions I don't know what to do. If you yourself want
</I>&gt;<i> to experiment, we could tell you how to massage the code for copying to hack
</I>&gt;<i> around.

</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> one thing that keeps me occupied: when a branching or propagator is

</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> constructed. This makes it difficult to make references to any data 
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> inside the space (which is simply not there yet in e.g. 
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> Branching::copy). Is there no other way? I understand that the 
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> branching/propagator cloning takes place in Space copy ctor, but it 
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> would be far more convenient for me to get a fully-constructed space 
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> in Branching::copy. (For example, I'm unable to construct some 
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> non-trivial references to space's data in my branching, as this 
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> initialization can't be moved out of the
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> constructor.)
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>       
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> That's just not possible in the current architecture.  If I understand
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> you correctly, you need to make sure that some object is cloned before 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> all actors (propagators &amp; branchings) are. That way, you can be sure 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> that that object is initialized when your Branching::copy is called.  
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> I have something like that in a private branch, I'll dig a bit and let

</I>&gt;<i> The thing is that the cloning of actors is (my guess) done in 
</I>&gt;<i> Space::Space. So say that I have derived my own space class Space2. My 
</I>&gt;<i> actors are passed, during cloning, a pointer to the new clone of Space2, 
</I>&gt;<i> but since the cloning of the actors is done in Space::Space, the Space2 
</I>&gt;<i> object is not fully initialized yet and I can not static_cast it to 
</I>&gt;<i> Space2 there.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Note that in the Space2::Space2() constructor (when creating the root 
</I>&gt;<i> space), I can make sure that the needed parts of Space2 are already 
</I>&gt;<i> constructed before posting the actor. So it came as a surprise to me 
</I>&gt;<i> that I got a runtime error in cloning, because things worked just fine 
</I>&gt;<i> for the root space. The space I saw being passed to the actor looked 
</I>&gt;<i> invalid, and it was not immediately obvious what was happening.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> One way that I think this could be handled is cloning in 2 steps: first 
</I>&gt;<i> create a copy of the space, then re-create the actors. Since, from the 
</I>&gt;<i> user's point of view, a space does not have explicit access to its 
</I>&gt;<i> actors (yet :-)), I don't see how this could be a problem (maybe just 
</I>&gt;<i> that it should be explicitly prohibited to create actors during 
</I>&gt;<i> cloning). The only thing is, who and how would trigger the cloning of 
</I>&gt;<i> the actors. Maybe Space::clone() could be &quot;protected&quot; and renamed to 
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;getClone&quot;, and there could be a public non-virtual
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Space* Space::clone() const {
</I>&gt;<i>   Space *pClone=getClone();
</I>&gt;<i>   pClone-&gt;copyActorsFrom(this);
</I>&gt;<i>   return pClone;
</I>&gt;<i> }
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> That's many maybes :-) Just wanted to explain what problems I am facing. 
</I>&gt;<i> But there are workarounds, so nothing serious.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Otherwise, the library works extremely well, bravo!
</I>&gt;<i>
