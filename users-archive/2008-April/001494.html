<PRE>Dear Christian,

Thank you very much for your useful information and advices.

My purpose is to design some search algorithms which deal with values and 
domains. In fact, I need at the same time the _min and _max value of the 
variable domain and the _current value that I try to instantiate.
As In Gecode, an instantiation makes the domain to reduce  to a single value 
(_min == _max), I need another &quot;int&quot; member to store the _current value 
without reducing the domain.

I am not sure that other people will absolutely need that, but It can be 
usefull to add its own data structure to an existing Gecode variable. Maybe a 
pointer to an object (NULL by default) given to the constructor. If a user 
wants to deal with this object, he must design a View which tackles the 
object.

As a conclusion, I will follow your advice and do the experiment first :-)

Thank you again,

Cheers,
Vincent

&gt;<i> Dear Vincent,
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> let me first elaborate a little bit how Gecode's variables and propagators
</I>&gt;<i> are structured before I actually attempt to give an answer.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Gecode has three important concepts regarding variables:
</I>&gt;<i>  - variables: they are used for modeling, and the only operations they
</I>&gt;<i> provide are good for modeling. In particular,
</I>&gt;<i>    variables to not provide operations to update their domain. Examples are
</I>&gt;<i> IntVar, BoolVar, etc. Variables are
</I>&gt;<i>    hence provide nothing but an interface to variable implementations
</I>&gt;<i> (actually, variables are implemented as
</I>&gt;<i>    a pointer to variable implementations).
</I>&gt;<i>  - variable implementations: they are the real objects storing the domain
</I>&gt;<i> and which propagators and advisors must be
</I>&gt;<i>    executed when the domain changes. They themselves are constructed in two
</I>&gt;<i> steps: a domain independent stub that is
</I>&gt;<i>    automatically generated from a simple description (just a few lines).
</I>&gt;<i> The stub is concerned with events, how
</I>&gt;<i>    propagators can be subscribed to, and linking the variable
</I>&gt;<i> implementations to the Gecode kernel etc. The real
</I>&gt;<i>    variable implementation then inherits from the generated stub and adds
</I>&gt;<i> the variable domain and so on.
</I>&gt;<i>  - views: like variables they are nothing but an interface for variable
</I>&gt;<i> implementations. However, views are used
</I>&gt;<i>    by propagators and branching and provide operations to update variable
</I>&gt;<i> domains, subscribe propagators to changes,
</I>&gt;<i>    and so on. More importantly, for the same variable implementation
</I>&gt;<i> several views exist: a MinusView for a variable
</I>&gt;<i>    implementation x, for example, provides an interface that behaves as if
</I>&gt;<i> the operations on the MinusView are executed
</I>&gt;<i>    on -x rather than x. Examples are IntView, BoolView, MinusView,
</I>&gt;<i> OffsetView, ... For more on views there is paper
</I>&gt;<i>    on the Gecode webpage.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Propagators themselves have two parts: a post function and the actual
</I>&gt;<i> propagator. A post function (such as rel, distinct, linear, etc.) is used
</I>&gt;<i> for modeling and hence takes variables as arguments. It then chooses the
</I>&gt;<i> right propagator and the right views (converting variables to views by
</I>&gt;<i> passing the underlying reference to the variable implementation).
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Propagators are typically parametric (as templates in C++) with respect to
</I>&gt;<i> the view they are using: for example, the Max propagator is instantiated
</I>&gt;<i> for the max posting function with an IntView whereas it is also
</I>&gt;<i> instantiated with a MinusView for the min posting function.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Sorry for the long blurb, let's move to the answer: as Gecode is designed,
</I>&gt;<i> you can reuse propagators provided that you implement: a variable
</I>&gt;<i> implementation by yourself (that's what you want to do), variables for them
</I>&gt;<i> (so that you can model), and views for them (so that you can reuse the
</I>&gt;<i> propagators), post functions (because they talk about your variables).
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> This is a lot of effort! If you want to make something that is used (rather
</I>&gt;<i> than an experiment), then one could also make views and variables
</I>&gt;<i> parametric wrt the variable implementation used. That is easy but requires
</I>&gt;<i> intimate Gecode knowledge. Then, in principal, one could also make the post
</I>&gt;<i> functions parametric but this is almost impossible in reality as they
</I>&gt;<i> should provide simple static linkage as they constitute the basic interface
</I>&gt;<i> to Gecode.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> So it really depends on what you want to do. For an experiment, hack the
</I>&gt;<i> variable implementation. For something, first do the experiment ;-)
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> What do you want to do? Do you think it me be generally useful to be
</I>&gt;<i> included in Gecode anyway?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> All the best
</I>&gt;<i> Christian

</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Hi,
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I am trying to extend IntVar in order to use it in my self(-made
</I>&gt;<i> algorithms. I would like to use an unaltered Gecode, but I need to add an
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;int&quot; member in
</I>&gt;<i> the IntVar implementation. I don't want to make my own Integer Variable
</I>&gt;<i> class
</I>&gt;<i> because I also need to use the algorithms designed in Gecode.
</I>&gt;<i> Is there a clean way to extend this class (by inheritance maybe ....) and
</I>&gt;<i> add
</I>&gt;<i> a member without altering Gecode ?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Thank you for your assistance.
</I>&gt;<i> Best regards,
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Vincent
