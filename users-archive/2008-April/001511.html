Can I do the reverse and only add variables to the space as they  
become relevant?

I've tried this and managed to bring the sizes down a bit. After  
making a couple of changes to prune unnecessary variables, I now have  
the following results for a 'small' problem with 1273 variables:

Clones: 43
Commits: 326
Fails: 1
Propagates: 658217

C_d    A_d    Memory (Mb)
8      2      210.6
50     10      45.1
100    10      30.1
200    10      21.9

This seems to improve things quite a bit, but I'm still somewhat  
disturbed by the size. I suspect that a lot of it may be accounted for  
by a large number of BExprs, which I believe create 'implicit'  
variables. Is that correct?

&gt;<i> For your particular example, I would really suspect some other

</I>&gt;<i> almost no

</I>
I agree that the crash I experienced was probably due to a memory  
leak, but the memory figures I quote above are those returned by  
Statistics.getMemory()? Am I right in thinking that they represent  
just the usage of the C++ engine?

With this memory usage being so large, there is no way I would be able  
to solve a 'large' instance of my problem. Do you have any guidelines  
for most efficient memory use?
