<PRE>Filip,

If you check the stubs for all the different variable types you will see
that there are two aspects in which they differ. Both of which depend on the
variable implementation specification you deliver:

 - Propagation conditions: a stub class allocates one slot for each
   propagation condition you specify. This is used to find all propagators
   with a particular propagation condition.

   As cloning is controlled by the kernel, the kernel needs to know
   how many slots a variable has so that all of its slots are copied.

 - Modification events: a modification event on a variable determines
   what are the propagators that must be propagated. For example, for
   integer variables, if the the min or max of a variable changes, this
   results in a ME_INT_BND modification event (one of the bounds changed).
   The specification contains the information that all propagators
   for that variable with conditions PC_INT_DOM (run if anything changes)
   and PC_INT_BND (run if the bounds change) must be run.

   The code that runs (actually schedules propagators for later execution)
   is generated from the specification as, again, this is done in the
   kernel. Moreover, the code is super optimized (really with number
   of assembly instructions in mind) as it is at the core of the kernel.

There is one more thing that happens (computing an optimal bit layout for
modification event deltas) but I won't go into that.

So you see, generating the stuff is somewhat less powerful (you need to
recompile) but has a great return if investment as it comes to speed.

Moreover, a kernel that has been compiled with a particular variable type
enabled can still be used without linking your programs to code that
implements the variable proper.
