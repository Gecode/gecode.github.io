<PRE>Hello again,

I have been experimenting with the questions raised in my previous mail.

I created a small Gecode space to be able to test the problem in a  
smaller scale, where I did use two variables (variable1, variable2,  
both IntVars with the domain {0,5}) and three constraints: variable1  
equals variable2, and variable2 cannot have the values 2 and 4.

In all of my tests the latter two constraints are described like that:

post(space, new BExpr(space.variable1, IRT_NQ, 2));
post(space, new BExpr(space.variable1, IRT_NQ, 4));

For the third constraint I had several tries. When I was using the  
rel() clause to write the constraint, I got the expected result:

Variable #1: {0..1,3,5}
Variable #2: {0..1,3,5}

But when using a similar construct I would like to use in the static  
verifier, I got no result for the second variable, it can has all  
values from it's domain.

post(space, new BExpr(space.variable1, IRT_EQ, space.variable2));

Reading about different propagators, I have been able to get the  
expected result with the use of the ICL_DOM propagator, but only if I  
was posting the constraint directly, like that:

post(space, new Expr(space.variable1), IRT_EQ, new  
Expr(space.variable2),org.gecode.GecodeEnumConstants.ICL_DOM);

But if I tried to translate the a BExprs to that form, I did not  
succeed:

	    Expr expression = new Expr(new  
Expr(space.variable2).minus(space.variable1));
	    post(space, new Expr(expression), IRT_EQ, 0,  
org.gecode.GecodeEnumConstants.ICL_DOM);

Can you tell me a way how to enable this strong ICL_DOM propagators  
meanwhile using the BExpr form, if it is possible? It would help our  
project a lot, it would simplify it's code.

Thank you for your help,
