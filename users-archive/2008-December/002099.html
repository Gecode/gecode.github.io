<PRE>Hi Christian,

&gt;<i>  - Gecode's quicksort uses O(log n) stackspace: it will always push the
</I>&gt;<i> larger array onto the stack,
</I>&gt;<i>   which will be at least n/2 long! That's O(log n).
</I>
I completely missed this, that's a very nice property to have! =)


&gt;<i>  - There is no difference (in principle) whether you use a strict or
</I>&gt;<i> non-strict ordering (as the complement
</I>&gt;<i>   will be the opposite).
</I>
Nevertheless, I think this is where the problem stems from. Strictness
can be a problem if the code makes assumptions about it. Partition()
seems to depend on strictness:

Suppose the array is completely sorted and consists of very many
duplicate elements. Specifically there are many elements past R that
have the same value as (*R). Then we can imagine a situation in which
line sort.icc:121 is executed many times and i goes arbitrarily far
past the R pointer (since (*i) == (*R) and thus (*i) &lt;= (*R) and thus
lt(*i, R*)). This would be impossible if the comparison was strict.
Continuing the trace, we reenter quicksort() with L &gt; R (ie. L is to
the right of R).


&gt;<i> The only problem I see is that 32 was not good enough.
</I>
Indeed, on 64-bit machines 32 is too small. I don't follow why the
&quot;sizeof(int)&quot;? I think this value should be something along the lines
of:

sizeof(void*) * std::numeric_limits&lt;unsigned char&gt;::digits

Ie. 64 on current 64bit systems.


&gt;<i> Could you be so kind
</I>&gt;<i> and retry what happens with replacing 32 by &quot;sizeof(int) * 64&quot;?
</I>
The sort is still running after 10 minutes and counting.

Using my dynamic stack I recall that I left it running for longer than
30 minutes before finally killing it.


&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Then, how much memory does your machine have?
</I>
4Gb of memory in the system + 8gb of pagefile. The program uses 600Mb
when I use the strict comparison operator and at a depth of about 30
spaces. Note that it works fine with a depth 32 stack so long as the
comparison operator is strict.


&gt;<i> Then, how deep does the stack
</I>&gt;<i> grow for Quicksort and how many elements does the array have you try to
</I>&gt;<i> sort?
</I>
The TupleSet contains 4728252 tuples. If you want, I can send you the data.

I recall that with the dynamic stack the stack depth exceeded 1024.

Cheers,

Michal

</I>&gt;<i> Subject: [gecode-users] Quicksort bug
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Hi All,
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I had one hell of a bug hunt recently. What started as a crash on winxp x64
</I>&gt;<i> ended up in a &quot;true&quot; being changed to a &quot;false&quot; on freebsd (so I could
</I>&gt;<i> sanely debug into the Gecode code base). The culprit was FullTupleCompare
</I>&gt;<i> (gecode/int/extensional/tuple-set.cc) but quicksort also got hit in the
</I>&gt;<i> cross-fire.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> FullTupleCompare implements a less than or equal (&lt;=) operator and not a
</I>&gt;<i> strict less than (&lt;) operator. In effect, for the case where both tuples are
</I>&gt;<i> identical up the arity it returns true instead of false.
</I>&gt;<i> This causes quicksort massive problems. See tuple-set.cc.diff for the fix.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> The gecode quicksort assumes that its stack will never exceed a depth of 32.
</I>&gt;<i> This was getting exceeded when used on a large tupleset with the above
</I>&gt;<i> comparison operator. However, in general this assumption is wrong. Stack
</I>&gt;<i> usage for quicksort is worst case O(n) depending on the values that are
</I>&gt;<i> chosen for the pivot! Exceeding the stack current results in an outright
</I>&gt;<i> crash as an out of bounds pointer is dereferenced. I toyed with two fixes:
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> 1) make push return a success/failure code and if the push fails then call
</I>&gt;<i> quicksort recursively instead of pushing onto the stack. See sort.icc.diff.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> 2) start off with an static stack and expand it dynamically if it's
</I>&gt;<i> exceeded. I'm not sure if Memory::malloc() / Memory::free() are the right
</I>&gt;<i> ways to go about grabbing memory. There is no performance penalty if the
</I>&gt;<i> stack depth does not exceed 32 entries. See sort.icc.diff2.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Both solutions have the overhead of checking if the stack is going to exceed
</I>&gt;<i> 32 entries on a push. This doesn't seem significant especially since most of
</I>&gt;<i> the work should be happening in partition. My vote is for fix # 2 as it
</I>&gt;<i> seems to be the more robust solution (no potential stack overflow).
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Cheers,
</I>&gt;<i>
