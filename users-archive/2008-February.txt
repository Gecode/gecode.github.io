Any idea how I do that in BibTex? I keep getting a reference to "G.

Subject: [gecode-users] count/atleast: partial propagation towards y ?
Message-ID: <1201972556.6556.48.camel@cowcot>

Hi,

I am trying to post a propagator for the constraint
   x' = x or x' = epsilon
with x and x' integer variables and epsilon some constant not in dom(x).

I first thought to use reified equality constraints but it would achieve
very few propagation (for example, removing values from x would not
remove them from x' as long as epsilon is in dom(x'))

Then I thought I could do the same with the count constraint: posting
   #(X | x_i = y) = 1
with X = [x, epsilon] and y = x'

But the count propagator (for #(X | x_i = y) >= 1) does not seem to
achieve domain-consistency towards y in this case: values that are not
present in the union of the domains of the x_i's are not removed from y.

To test this I wrote this little program:

class TestCount : public Example {
protected:
  IntVar v, w, x;
public:
  TestCount(const Options& opt)
    : v(this, 1, 10), w(this, 2, 4), x(this, 7, 9) {
        IntVarArray tab(this, 2);
        tab[0] = w; tab[1] = x;
        exactly(this, tab, v, 1);
        branch(this, tab, INT_VAR_SIZE_MIN, INT_VAL_MIN);
  }

  // ?
}

and I obtain solutions like v=[1..10] w=2 x=7. Shouldn't it propagate
v={2,7} ? Did I do something wrong ?

If what I am trying to do is not possible using count, what is the best
way to implement it, achieving domain consistency ?

Thank you in advance for your help.

Didier

Hi,

You can model this using set-constraints.  Given are variables x', x,  
and epsilon. Using a temporary set-variable S, add the following  
constraints

	rel(this, SOT_DUNION, [x,epsilon], S)
	
	rel(this, S, SRT_SUP, x')

The first will make S be the union of the (disjoint) domains of x and  
epsilon. The second makes sure that x' is a member of that set.


If you are concerned with efficieny, then you could add a custom  
propagator for this constraint.


Cheers,
Mikael

I realised that I actually implemented this constraint about a year
ago, and dug it out. The code below can be used to propagate "x=y |
x=z"  for integer variables x, y, and z by using Extra::diseq(home, x,
y, z). I haven't tested it thoroughly, but I believe that it works.

Mikael

Hi,

I figured out I only answered to Mikael so I forward my response below.

Thank you Mikael for your implementation.

Ok I just tried this on my little example, and it solves the problem
I have with count, but it is not enough alone: if epsilon is removed
from dom(x') it will not propagate x = x' until x' is assigned
(which adds its value to the glb of S, if I'm not wrong)

I suppose it will work if I combine it with count/exactly.

Thank you very much for your help.

I would appreciate to understand why it does not work with count alone,
if anybody knows?

Didier

Hello to all, 

A question:

When I post a constraint on a solved space, it seems to be not
always propagated ... And this _not_always_ is what I am
worrying about - I want to know what is the rule. What I
mean is prety much like this:
---- code -----
int
get_weight(){
	IntVar weight(this, 0, Limits::Int::int_max);
	linear(this, this->vars, IRT_EQ, weight);
	/* 
	   this->status();
	 */
	return weight.val();
}
---- code -----

I invoke this function like 
	solved_space->get_weight()
from within the constrain() function (for BAB search). 
Without the line 
	   this->status();
I experienced assertion fault due to weight.max() !=
weight.min() : max, min remained the same as at the time of
initialization of weight.

Then I added the commented line and it worked fine. 

But... I have another function I invoke on solved spaces,
which workes fine without the status() invocation.

What do I have to know about constraints on solved spaces?
Could you short explain, or give a hint for reading?

Thank you in advance for your support!

		 http://contraintes.inria.fr/CPAIOR08

____ Scope ____

  Bin Packing and Placement problems are an old but still challenging
  topic that has been tackled with different approaches.

  On the one hand, the aim of this workshop is to share recent progress
  made on pure problems by using any technique (or the mix) like Mixed
  Integer Linear Programming, Local Search, or Constraint Programming.

  On the other hand, the aim is to present challenging problems formulated
  and/or solved by these methods, or challenging extensions that have a
  practical interest and for which pure methods do not directly work.

  Submitted papers can be

       * Extended Abstracts of new results or
       * Abstract of ongoing works
       * Systems presentations (with demos at the workshop)
       * Summaries of already accepted or recently published results

  on any topic concerning bin packing and placement constraints.

____ Call for Workshops ____

   The CP 2008 Program Committee invites proposals for the Workshop
   Program.

   CP 2008 workshops will provide an informal setting where workshop
   participants will have the opportunity to discuss specific
   technical topics in an atmosphere that facilitates the active
   exchange of ideas.  It is an opportunity to disseminate work in
   progress or to promote new and emerging areas within the field of
   constraints. The topics of the workshops can cover any area related
   to constraints and any related cross-disciplinary areas.  Workshops
   related to planning and scheduling are especially encouraged
   because of the co-location with ICAPS 2008.

   All workshops will take place during 14-15 September 2008 as
   pre-conference activities along tutorials and the doctoral program.

   Workshops can be half-day or full-day.  The internal format of the
   workshop will be determined by the organisers.

____ Call for Tutorials ____

   The CP 2008 Program Committee invites proposals for the Tutorial
   Program.

   CP 2008 tutorials are ideally targeted at the whole constraint
   community and should give a state-of-the-art description of a field
   of research related to constraint programming or of a large area of
   application.  For example, the topics of tutorials in previous CP
   conferences include: symmetry-breaking, on-line stochastic
   optimisation, distributed constraints, problem modelling,
   preference representation, randomised backtracking, dynamic
   constraint programming, numerical CSPs, global constraints, soft
   constraints, mathematical programming, cooperation between methods,
   and areas of application (e.g. bioinformatics, configuration).

   Tutorials will take place as pre-conference activities along with
   workshops and the doctoral program, which run during 14-15
   September 2008.


____ Dates ____

   Proposal submission                        18 March 2008

The rule is that some easy inferences may be done immediately on  
posting the constraint, but full propagation only happens when you  
call status.

Although this works (if you use status), it is not the recommended way  
of doing it.  What you should really do is:

int
get_weight() {
   int w = 0;
   for (int i=0; i<vars.size(); i++)
     w += vars[i].val();
   return w;
}

The problem with your approach is that if you add variables and  
constraints, you're not guaranteed that all the variables will be  
assigned after calling status.  It works in the above example, because  
you add a single constraint, and the new variable can be computed as a  
function from the old variables.  As soon as you try something more  
involved, you may need a nested search to actually determine the  
values.  Another disadvantage is that your version will be  
considerably slower than a simple computation of the sum.

Constraints on solved spaces are exactly the same as on unsolved  
spaces.  You're not guaranteed to get a solution without search.

Subject: [gecode-users] LDS search
Message-ID: <000c01c8683e$870aeb80$9520c280$@se>

Dear Stefano,

I just finished thorough tests for all search engines including LDS. Now all
pass the tests (DFS and BAB were of course working, Restart had two small
quirks, and LDS was disgustingly broken). We should have done these tests
much earlier. Sorry, Stefano!

I also improved LDS a lot in that the search engine now detects when the
entire tree has been explored: it will then not continue probing with a
discrepancy limit.

This was the last piece missing for 2.0.1 which should be out either
tomorrow or the day after. That will also be the version on which the next
Gecode/J is based.

Cheers and thanks again
Christian

The real functions actually return an IntVar, and for a
solved space I take the .val(), for unsolved space I add
some constraints on the Var.

My intention was to have the computation code only once for
the sake of simplicity and maintainability, sacrificing some
(minimal, as I thought) efficiency.

I didn't see the issue with the search. 
Thank you very much for your explanation.

Did you put /home/cipriano/gecode2.0/lib on your LD_LIBRARY_PATH?  If  
not, that may solve your problem.

Hello again, thank you for the suggestion: now the "fz" executables load

The .fzn files are correct, in fact invoking

$ flatzinc test.fzn

correctly solve the instances...

Do you have any suggestion?

Maybe your source files have Windows newline characters instead of  
Unix newline, I think the lexer doesn't handle those yet.  Try to run  
the sources through dos2unix, I hope that helps.  I'll see how to  
change the lexer accordingly.

Hi,

to make the HTML API a bit more readable and structured I would suggest 
to highlight each function description header such that a fast 
scolling/browsing is possible.

For that I suggest the following tag to the documentation css that draws 
a light grey box for the according div element

================================================
div.memproto {
	background-color: #FAFAFA;
	border: 1px solid #E0E0E0;
}
================================================

Maybe give it a try. :)

Ok, using dos2unix fix the problem and I can run the test.fzn file, 
thank you very much!
Perhaps I  misunderstood... I thought the parser would have returned a 
gecode space in a c++ file, for example golomb_0.cc, to be compiled and 
executed...is the gecode space only an internal translation? is it 
directly executed by the fz command?


Anywat I have some problem with the golomb_0.fzn code: fz gives me these 
error message:

$ Error: syntax error in line no. 33

    where line 33 is

33     int: gol_length = 17;

I can delete this line (gol_length is never used in the file), but I get


$ Error: Registry: Constraint int_lin_lt not found in line no. 280

    and line 280 is

279    constraint
280          int_lin_lt([ -1, 1, 1, -1 ], [ mark[0], mark[1], mark[4], 
mark[5] ], 0);


It seems that it doesn't recognize the int_lin_lt constrain...the file 
(that correctly runs using $flatzinc golomb_0.fzn ) was generated with 
the mzn2fzn parser...suggestion?

Thank you

Cheers

We are proud to announce the release of


                  QeCode 1.2 for Gecode 2.0.1

http://www.univ-orleans.fr/lifo/software/qecode/


QeCode is a solver for Quantified Constraint Satisfaction Problems
(QCSP) built on top of Gecode.  All constraints available in Gecode can
be used in quantified problems.  QeCode implements an extension of pure
QCSP called QCSP+ which allows to model problems in a natural way using
restricted quantification.  A short introduction to QeCode programming
is provided in the project home page.

QeCode 1.2 requires Gecode 2.0.1 and can be run on Windows, Linux
and Mac OS X.  Source code is provided as a contribution available in  
the
Gecode archive.

This software is released under MIT licence.

The current FlatZinc specification [1] does not include int_lin_lt as
a constraint, so this is actually a bug in the translation or the
specification (see Section A.1 Comparison operations).

Apparently, the online specification is not the newest version.  I'll  
add the new constraints and release an updated FlatZinc/Gecode soon.

Hi,

Two of the standard examples that come with Gecode have custom  
branchings, peacably co-existing armies of queens (queen-armies.cc)  
and black hole patience (black-hole.cc).

For a simple custom propagator, see the example in the mailing list  
this week (http://www.gecode.org/gecode-users/2008-February/001897.html)

I may have asked this before. If I have, please forgive me for asking  
again.

Suppose I have variables X1 ... Xn and Y1 ... Yn, with the constraints

distinct(X1, ..., Xn)
distinct(Y1, ..., Yn)

I now want to add the constraint:

Yi notin {Xj | j != i}, for i = 1 ... n

What would be the most efficient way to do this?

I could, of course, express it as:

Yi != X0
Yi != X1
...
Yi != Xi-1
Yi != Xi+ 1
...
Yi != Xn

The downside of this is that it would introduce a bunch of boolean  
variables to keep track of.

Alternatively. I could say:

distinct(X1, .., Xi-1, Yi, Xi+1, ... Xn)

which is overkill, but doesn't add any extra constraints that are not  
already covered by the original distinct(X1, ..., Xn) constraint.

Any suggestions as to which is likely to be better? Or is there  
another way?

They absolutely end up pointing to the same variable, otherwise the
semantics would differ between the original space and the copy.

Behind the scenes, both an IntVar and an IntView (for example) contain
a pointer to the real variable. During the copying procedure, this
real variable is copied only once, and a forwarding pointer is
recorded so that all instances of IntVars and IntViews pointing to
this variable can follow the forwarding pointer.

Mikael

Why would this add any extra Boolean variables? As far as I can see,
it is just a bunch of very simple propagators (the decomposition of
the constraint distinct(X1, .., Xi-1, Yi, Xi+1, ... Xn)).

With domain consistency, this model would do more pruning than the
above decomposition. Consider variables x1,x2,x3 and y1,y2,y3 with
domains
    x1,y2 in {1,2}
    x2,x3,y1,y3 in {1,2,3}
then the constraint
    distinct(x1,y2,x3)
would assign x3 the value 3, even though none of the variables is
assigned and neither distinct(x1,x2,x3) nor distinct(y1,y2,y3) would
prune anything.

On the other hand, there is a large number of such constraints, and
the overhead might not be worth the potential extra pruning.


> Any suggestions as to which is likely to be better? Or is there
> another way?

I think you just have to test how the different models work in you
specific case. I would suggest that you distinct with all the
different levels of pruning, as well as the decomposition.


Hope this helps,
Mikael

Hi,

I am making a PhD in Ilog. Yet I am trying to make a parser to use solve minizinc model with Ilog product. My frame work is to use the minizinc to flazinc translation and next to parse the flazinc model a write a model in our concept.

Yet I am trying to do the same with Gecode. I use Gecode 2.0.0 and flatzinc-gecode-1.0, but I can?t solve model produce by minizinc to flatzinc. This give an error if its meet a constant (i.e : int I = 3).

What can I do to correct this?


Thanks in advance.

Hi,

This issue was brought up recently in the mailing list, and Guido
fixed it in the current Gecode flatzinc trunk. You can access it
through
   $ svn co --username anonymous

We would like to announce the release of

                   FlatZinc for Gecode 1.1
         http://www.gecode.org/flatzinc.html

This release fixes several bugs and brings Gecode/FlatZinc
closer to the FlatZinc specification:

  * Added support for constant declarations (like int: a=3;)
  * New constraints required by FlatZinc specification (mostly  
int_lin_*)
  * More verbose error reports
  * Accept carriage return (Windows end-of-line)
  * Fixed bug in output of Boolean variables

FlatZinc is a low-level modelling language for constraint
problems. It is designed to be easily interfaceable to constraint
solvers (like Gecode). For more information on FlatZinc, please
refer to

http://www.g12.cs.mu.oz.au/minizinc/

We provide a parser that reads a FlatZinc model from a file, and
returns a Gecode Space object that represents the model. We
also provide a simple front-end, an executable program that
reads a FlatZinc model and prints the solution (if any) on the
standard output.

FlatZinc for Gecode requires the just-released Gecode 2.0.1, and
can be built and run on Windows, Linux, and Mac OS X.

Cheers,
	Guido

Dear Guido,
I'have installed the "Flatzinc for Gecode 1.1" release, and it works.
But perhaps I  misunderstood something... I thought that the parser would have returned a 
gecode space in a c++ file, for example I thought that executing 

$ fz myInstanceOfGolombRulers.fzn
 
should have create a myInstanceOfGolombRulers.cc file

to be compiled and executed...but it doesn't seem to work in this way...

Is the gecode space only an internal translation? 
Is it directly executed by the fz command?

Thank you 

Raffaele

No, Gecode/FlatZinc is an interpreter for FlatZinc, not a compiler.   
The advantage is that no additional step of compilation is needed -  
the user does not have to have a C++ compiler installed.

Yes, the fz command creates a new space, parses the input and creates  
all variables and propagators, and then calls one of the search  
engines.  If you need more direct access to the space that results  
from parsing, you can use Gecode/FlatZinc as a library.  Have a look  
at the file main.cc.  The two lines
   FZPrinter p;
   FlatZincGecode* fg = FlatZinc::solve(contents, p);
Parse the string contents into a gecode space fg (FlatZincGecode  
inherits from Gecoode::Space).

If you need a compiler that generates C++ from FlatZinc, you may want  
to look at the new reflection capabilities (introduced in Gecode  
2.0.0).  They would let you take the FlatZincGecode object, iterate  
over all its propagators and variables, and generate C++ code that  
recreates an equivalent space.

Cheers,
	Guido

Another question: I have two lists of variables X1 ... Xn and Y1 ...  
Yn. I want to constrain them so that at most one (or exactly one) of  
the Xi's differs from the corresponding Yi.

This is one of those things that would propagate better with a  
specialised constraint. Does such a constraint exist (in Gecode/J)?

If we had booleans Bi = (Xi = Yi), this could be represented by a  
constraint which said that at most (or exactly) one Bi was true. Does  
such a constraint exist?

In answer to my own question, BoolVar extends IntVar, so the standard  
Gecode.count() methods will work.

Counting BoolVars is slightly overkill, since linear relations work
equally well.

Also, from Gecode 2.0 BoolVars are no longer IntVars, and there are no
counting constraints for the new BoolVars (again since that is
captured by linear relations).

The closest constraint available is a count constraint that counts the
number of x_i=y_i that holds for a variable array x and array of
constants y.

If both of the arrays are variables, you will have to use the reified
version that you described.

____ Call for Application Papers ____

   The CP conference is the annual international conference on
   constraint programming.  It is concerned with all aspects of
   computing with constraints.

   CP 2008 wishes to promote the presentation of CP applications.
   Reports on successful applications of constraint technology are
   therefore particularly encouraged.  They are subject to special
   Applications track reviewing and acceptance criteria:

    -  Application papers will be reviewed by a special committee of
       people with much experience in the use of CP in applications.

    -  The writing of the paper itself is made simple by framing it
       around the answers to four main questions (outlined below).

   Accepted application papers will appear in the same proceedings as
   research papers, which will be published by Springer Verlag in the
   Lecture Notes in Computer Science series.  Papers are limited to 15
   LNCS pages.  Further author information is provided on the
   conference webpage.

Message-ID: <63034b790802140019x2e01084cn9a5d5056cbb76580@mail.gmail.com>

Hi all,

Right now, I'm working on a heuristic using Gecode, and I need to record
some information during the propagation process.
So far things are going well, but now I'm facing a problem with re-writable
propagators because sometimes there is call to GECODE_REWRITE which (if I
understand well), removes the current propagator from the space and impose
another one, but in (
http://www.gecode.org/gecode-doc-latest/int_2element_2view_8icc-source.html#l00537)
[ViewDom<VA,VB,VC>::propagate -- line 537] there is an explicit imposition
of DomEq  (i.e. dispose the current propagator and creates the new one.),
please let me know, whether these two things are the same or not.


Thanks in advance.

Best,
Alejandro

Exactly.

They are essentially the same - have a look at the definition of  
GECODE_REWRITE at
http://www.gecode.org/gecode-doc-latest/macros_8icc-source.html#l00115

The reason why we explicitly create the new propagator and then  
subsume the old one here is how Rel::EqDom::post works:
http://www.gecode.org/gecode-doc-latest/int_2rel_2eq_8icc-source.html#l00142
It first checks for assignment, and then checks that the arguments are  
not the same, and only then posts the propagator.  But in the element  
case, we already know that none of the variables is assigned and  
they're not the same, so we want to avoid the checks.  And the  
GECODE_REWRITE macro cannot cope with propagators created via new, it  
requires them to be created by a post function.

I hope this clarifies things!

Cheers,
	Guido

Hello,
How can I get all the solutions to a problem using gecode.
I can use options and say: opt.solutions(10);
But how can I get all the solutions available,
is there any other way? or do I have to specify
the number of all possible solutions?

Thank you

Dear all:

I override the "constrain" function to get the optima solution. But when I try to get some IntVar variables of the space in the function,
a runtime error occurs, it says I  try to get the value of some unassigned IntVar variable. 
What's the possible mistake of my code?

Thanks in advance!

Subject: [gecode-users] posting LinExpr
Message-ID: <20080214105937.GA28005@fiesta.cs.tu-berlin.de>

Hello,

I have some irritating experience with posting a LinExpr

=== Short:
The returned by LinExpr::post variable has different bounds
than expected.



=== Long:

1.  Background

I have a functon like this:

=-=-=-=-=-=Begin
IntVar
Constraints::get_variable_difference(Solver *space, IntVar& var1, int var2 ){

        return abs(space, post(space, var1 - var2, ICL_DOM), ICL_DOM);
}
=-=-=-=-=-=End

The variables returned by it are intended  to be stored in
an IntVarArray and then  I can obtain a variable holding the
total difference like this:
=-=-=-=-=-=Begin
linear(space, all_diffs,  IRT_EQ, total_diff) )
=-=-=-=-=-=End

And I can *after that* constrain the total_diff 
in the constrain() function (for BAB search).

So I consider this whole process to be kind of query, not
modifying the meaningful vars in the space, i.e. I
do not expect the added variables to impact solvability of
the space. (total_diff has initially the domain [0, int_max]
and the sum over all_diffs is not more than 1000)

The problem is that while filling the all_diffs array, after
some iterations, the space is reported to have status
SS_FAILED. Precisely, it gets failed, after the first
invocation of get_variable_difference() with var2!=0.

2. Problem

In a debugger session I found out, that the invocation:
=-=-=-=-=-=Begin
get_variable_difference(space, var1, 64 );
=-=-=-=-=-=End
where the domain of var1 is {0, 64}, the posting 
post(space, var1 - var2, ICL_DOM) returns an IntVar with
domain [64, 128], while I expect [-64, 0].

(Other invocation with var1={64} and var2=64 resulted in
{128}, while expecting {0} )

I took a look at  the definition of LinExpr::post in
http://www.gecode.org/gecode-doc-search-1.3.1/lin-expr_8cc-source.html#l00074
and I noticed, that the doubles min and max are both
initialized to sign*-c, which in my case means min=max=-(-64)=64 .
Adding the bounds of my var1 to this really results in the
returned variables. Is this correct?
The following Int::Linear::post in line 94 could explain the
failing of the space, since it is in my opinion really not
satisfiable. 

Do you see some problem with the code?
There might be some issue with domain consistency and posting
linear expressions?


Thanks a lot for your suggestions.


cheers
stanio

That you try to access the value (using the val() member function) of
a variable that is not assigned. Check that you are accessing the
value of a variable form the right space, and that the variable should
in fact be assigned (you have all the branchings that are needed).

I guess you mistyped something here, I can't see how the constraint  
0=0 can be of any use.

   post(this, x[i] - x[i+1] == answer[i] - answer[i+1]);

should do the trick (you have to include gecode/minimodel.hh for this

Hi Stanimir,

not so shy ;-) That was a bug, apparently there were no tests for posting
linear expressions but only linear relations! I'll fixed it in the trunk and
it should be soon in 2.0.2. For the time being, just replace sign*-c with
sign*c and recompile...

Sorry about the inconvenience. 

As had become clear recently with the embarrassing number of bugs found, we
have been looking again to which test coverage we have. For the kernel and
integer propagators we have almost 100%. For search prior to 2.0.1 we only
had around 75% with restart and LDS missing, that has been corrected. For
the next release we will try to be close to 100% everywhere.

Sorry again
Christian

Subject: [gecode-users] posting LinExpr

Hello,

I have some irritating experience with posting a LinExpr

=== Short:
The returned by LinExpr::post variable has different bounds
than expected.



=== Long:

1.  Background

I have a functon like this:

=-=-=-=-=-=Begin
IntVar
Constraints::get_variable_difference(Solver *space, IntVar& var1, int var2
){

        return abs(space, post(space, var1 - var2, ICL_DOM), ICL_DOM);
}
=-=-=-=-=-=End

The variables returned by it are intended  to be stored in
an IntVarArray and then  I can obtain a variable holding the
total difference like this:
=-=-=-=-=-=Begin
linear(space, all_diffs,  IRT_EQ, total_diff) )
=-=-=-=-=-=End

And I can *after that* constrain the total_diff 
in the constrain() function (for BAB search).

So I consider this whole process to be kind of query, not
modifying the meaningful vars in the space, i.e. I
do not expect the added variables to impact solvability of
the space. (total_diff has initially the domain [0, int_max]
and the sum over all_diffs is not more than 1000)

The problem is that while filling the all_diffs array, after
some iterations, the space is reported to have status
SS_FAILED. Precisely, it gets failed, after the first
invocation of get_variable_difference() with var2!=0.

2. Problem

In a debugger session I found out, that the invocation:
=-=-=-=-=-=Begin
get_variable_difference(space, var1, 64 );
=-=-=-=-=-=End
where the domain of var1 is {0, 64}, the posting 
post(space, var1 - var2, ICL_DOM) returns an IntVar with
domain [64, 128], while I expect [-64, 0].

(Other invocation with var1={64} and var2=64 resulted in
{128}, while expecting {0} )

I took a look at  the definition of LinExpr::post in
http://www.gecode.org/gecode-doc-search-1.3.1/lin-expr_8cc-source.html#l0007
4
and I noticed, that the doubles min and max are both
initialized to sign*-c, which in my case means min=max=-(-64)=64 .
Adding the bounds of my var1 to this really results in the
returned variables. Is this correct?
The following Int::Linear::post in line 94 could explain the
failing of the space, since it is in my opinion really not
satisfiable. 

Do you see some problem with the code?
There might be some issue with domain consistency and posting
linear expressions?


Thanks a lot for your suggestions.


cheers

To me, this looks like a bug in gcc's parser.  It confuses the less- 
than operator with a template argument.  Do you really use gcc 4.0.0?   
The current version that comes with XCode is 4.0.1, and as I use it  
every day, I'm sure it doesn't have this problem.

Cheers,
	Guido

I prefer messing around with my code, than with gecode's, so
I use a workaround for now (the constants are 0 and this
avoids the impact of sign*-c):

=-=-=-=-=-=Begin
   IntVar
   get_variable_difference(Solver *space, IntVar& var1, int var2){
-          return abs(space, post(space, var1 - var2, ICL_DOM), ICL_DOM);
+          IntVar tmp(space, var2, var2);
+          return  abs(space, post(space, var1 - tmp, ICL_DOM), ICL_DOM);
   }
=-=-=-=-=-=End

Could using a temp IntVar (and as consequence one Term more
inside the LinExpr, I guess) be a considerable performance
issue?

Hi,

no the variable will be eliminated immediately when the propagator runs. So
after the first propagation everything is as it should be.

Hi,

Actually it should be pretty easy: Look to gecode/int/branch.cc and the
function create in gecode/int/branch/sel-val.icc and you will see that both
variable and value selection is described by simple classes that are then
used to parametrize a branching called ViewValBranching. As you might guess
you'll find lots of examples there.

So, what you have to do: you just write your own value selection class,
reuse the view selection classes and you are done. Very easy.

Cheers
Christian

Just use linear and rel constraints to do that, a little math tells you:

                q[i] + i != q[j] + j ? q[i] ? q[j] != j-i

Subject: [gecode-users] Profiling examples using the Common Lisp Gecode
	wrapper
Message-ID: <a6b4b44a0802202352y32e49fb0qebac795a7b55691d@mail.gmail.com>

Hello,
I am doing some profiling to gecode examples under the Common Lisp wrapper.
For the examples alpha and eq20 it takes around 5 to 10 times more to be
executed.
But, when running queens with size = 30 it takes around 100 times more time
to be executed.

What could be happening?
What other examples should I try?

Thanks

Hello,
I am getting this error when trying to run the
"stress-distinct" example using the common lisp wrapper.

Perhaps somebody has a clue:

Assertion failed: (dom.min() == dom.max()), function val,
 file /usr/local/include/gecode/int/var/imp-int.icc, line 223.

The lisp interpreter is giving me that error.

Thanks :)

That could depend on many things. Maybe you are introducing some
overhead by the layer you are developing between CL and gecode, that
is not for free. It may also depends on the CL implementation. My
pinion is to see how much overhead occur when you take the same
problem and change the size, queens is a good example for this. Try
Queens with n=10, n=15, etc. and try to devise some constant relation
between gecode and CL results. That constant relation can give you an
impression f the overhead introduced. If that relation is not constant
maybe there is something wrong with your implementation.

Do not expect to have the same gecode times. Gecode is run as an OS
process and is highly optimized, on the other side you are on the top
of an emulator or virtual machine.

> What other examples should I try?

Try as many examples as you want but try to find a relation instead to
try finding the same results.


As i said before, there can be many things causing that results the
goal then is to quantify how slower is the wrapper compared to
"vanilla" gecode. I would expect to see something like CL = K*G where
CL is the running time of your examples and G is the time spent for
the same problem in gecode. The important thing is K.

Just a hint, be careful you built gecode without debugging support.

Hope this helps,

Not necessarily.  If search is done within Gecode, the overhead is  
entirely in the problem setup.  If, e.g., creating an IntVar through  
the wrapper is expensive, then scaling up the problem size will result  
in a bigger and bigger gap between native and wrapped solver.  If the  
wrapper does a lot of work in order to extract the values of the  
variables each time a solution is found, this may also be a  
significant factor.

One thing to watch out for is that the wrapped solver actually  
executes exactly the same problems.  E.g., are the IntConLevel  
arguments translated properly? Are the c_d and a_d arguments for the  
search engines the same?

Another thing is memory management.  How often are things copied  
around when passing them through the interface?  Are spaces freed  
early, or are they kept alive for too long (which might cause trashing)?

Then, finally, how do you measure the run time?  Our strategy is to  
run each problem a certain, problem-specific number of iterations, and  
then divide the overall runtime by the number of iterations to get the  
time for a single run.  That way you make sure that the resolution of  
the timer is actually accurate enough for your measurements.  In  
addition, we do these measurements for a number of samples, so that we  
can compare the coefficient of deviation, to make sure that we used  
enough iterations.

If all else fails, you'll have to run a version of your wrapped solver  
that was configured with profiling turned on (-pg switch for gcc), and  
then use gprof to find bottlenecks.

> Just a hint, be careful you built gecode without debugging support.

That's a very valuable hint, we've gone into that trap many times  
ourselves ;-)

I'd guess that you're accessing the value of a yet unassigned  
variable.  I don't know where you access it, and I don't know why any  
variable in stress-distinct should be unassigned, but that's what it  
looks like.

Also, this is a strong hint at the fact that you're using a debug  
build of Gecode, otherwise the assertion wouldn't have fired.  Is that  
the version that you tried to run your performance experiments on?   
That would explain the differences.

Guido

Message-ID: <8032a5cd0802220936i772f0ce3t7293045a1a451615@mail.gmail.com>

I'm having a problem with Gecode 2.0.0 on Windows XP Professional.  My
application seems to work fairly well on many cases, but I have two cases
that run for about 9 minutes before declaring that the heap memory is
exhausted.

I have tried the following:
1. Modifying boot.ini to add the /3GB flag to increase the individual
application memory limit.
2. Adjusting a_d and c_d (using DFS).  I have tried (c_d=16, a_d=8) and
(c_d=20, a_d=1000).
3. Recompiling with heap memory reservation increased from 1MB (default as I
understand) to 8 MB.

All of these lead to the same result.  Here is a printout of the search
stats:

Ran out of memory!!! (Memory: Heap memory exhausted)
Stats: Search Stats

Initial
        propagators:   68
        branchings:    2

        commits:       36777015
        peak memory:   646672 KB


No matter what I try these numbers do not change.

Thanks in advance for any help,
-Joe

A quick note -- just to be sure I downloaded the binaries for Gecode
2.0.1and recompiled/linked against that.  It took a little longer to
run (~11
minutes), but then it stopped with exactly the same results.

Thanks,

This is hard to analyze without some more facts about your model.   
E.g., how many variables do you create, and how big are the initial  
domains?  What kind of variables (IntVar, SetVar, CpltSetVar?) and  
constraints?

Apparently the search space is huge.  This is normally no problem for  
Gecode, unless the search tree is also very, very deep (memory  
consumption should be linear in the tree depth).  So if you have many  
variables with large domains and little propagation, the tree could be  
very deep, and the result is that the system gives up.  In this case,  
I'm not sure you can solve the problem by just using more memory,  
you're going to need a "stronger" model.  If, on the other hand, the  
tree is not so deep, it must be a bug (a memory leak) in Gecode, and  
we'd be most interested to get your actual model so that we can find  
out what's wrong.

Cheers,
	Guido

What would also be helpful is looking to the Windows Task Manager and see
how much memory the process uses.

It looks like the problem was the domain size.  I manually rescaled the
domain down by a factor of 100, and it worked (very quickly), even with full
recomputation.

Thanks for all of your help,

Wow, that's amazing: what kind of propagators did you use? Normally, domain
size is never an issue (Gecode has really the smallest implementation one
could think of in terms of memory consumption).

 

But on the other hand, using sensible domain is an important part of
modeling practice:

-          if domains are too big and domain-consistent propagation is used,
then too many holes are created using lots of memory (that must have been
your case)

-          if domains are too big and arithmetic constraints are used, they
either have to resort to less efficient numerical types internally or they
even might throw an exception due to potential of numerical overflow (Gecode
prides itself that it will never silently and incorrectly overflow)

 

So, as always: small is beautiful ;-)

 

All the best

Christian

It looks like the problem was the domain size.  I manually rescaled the
domain down by a factor of 100, and it worked (very quickly), even with full
recomputation.

Thanks for all of your help,

The application is a schedule generator for non-preemptive real-time
distributed systems.

It ends up as a fairly large collection of global serialization constraints
and arithmetic constraints (both equality and inequality).  There is also a
little bit of disjunction in some cases, but the case I was working with
here didn't have any disjunctive constraints.  Before building the model
there was a procedure to try and infer a good level of discretization for
the problem, but today I replaced that with a resolution parameter specified
by the user.  Obviously the discretization was too aggressive :-(

Thanks again for all of your help,

Subject: [gecode-users] Problem linking Gecode 2.0.1 libreries
Message-ID: <47C6D06A.5070702@dimi.uniud.it>

Dear GECODE developers and users,
I have sucessfully installed GECODE 2.0.1 on my PC (cygwin on Windows XP 
32bit), and I'm trying to compile an example, the queens.cc file...
I have some problems linking the libraries (compiling the file is ok).
I've also installed GECODE 2.0.1 on a cluster x86_64  with Linux CentOS 
v.4.3 and  2.6.9-34.ELsmp CentOS Kernel, and I get the same problem.

 I get this message

It seems there's some trouble with the class Options or SizeOptions and 
with the distinct contraint (line 80 is  distinct(this, q, opt.icl());  )


Could you help me?

Thank you

You seem to compile a 2.0.1 queens against a 1.3.1 gecode.  That will  
certainly fail.  Also, could you please quote the compiler version  
you're using, for gcc it makes a difference whether 3.x or 4.x is  
used, as the latter supports symbol visibility annotations.

Cheers,

Hi,

In addition to Guido's comments, you should be aware that the
SizeOptions class is defined in the support files in the examples
directory. These are not in the library files. To use the examle
support, you must also link it to the following object files:
    examples/support.o
    examples/timer.o
    examples/support/example.o
    examples/support/options.o

Cheers,
Mikael Lagerkvist

Hello,
I am trying to make a little program for set's difference.
I found some info at sudoko's example.. but I have not
been able to make the difference work :(

I have this code:

          SetVar a = SetVar(this);
          SetVar b = SetVar(this);
          SetVar c = SetVar(this);
          SetVarArray answer = SetVarArray(this,2);

          dom (this, a, SRT_EQ , 1, 5);
          dom (this, b, SRT_EQ , 3, 10);

          //c = a - b
          // answer = c ??
          rel (this, a, SOT_MINUS, b, SRT_EQ, c);
          rel (this, SOT_UNION, answer, c);



 //SET_VAR_MIN_CARD  With smallest unknown set.
//SET_VAL_MIN  Select smallest value in unknown set
branch(this, answer, SET_VAR_NONE, SET_VAL_MIN);

Subject: [gecode-users] Gecode 2.1.0, Gecode/J 2.1.0,
	Gecode/FlatZinc 1.2 released
Message-ID: <6EA2E1C9-5169-4CBC-8E80-628DF3F93E1F@ps.uni-sb.de>

We would like to announce the release of

                   Gecode 2.1.0
            http://www.gecode.org

This release makes two essential contributions: a partly reimplemented  
kernel that is faster, is simpler, and uses less memory and lots of  
small and not so small fixes. This release is the first release where  
really everything that we can test (rather than everything that we  
initially believed to matter) has been systematically tested. So,  
better switch now to 2.1.0!
Apart from that, the value range for variables has been increased  
(basically, 32 bits minus three values, so that is 32 bits), the  
reflection API is now fully functional and no longer considered  
experimental, and we have the usual small additions.

We also release

                   Gecode/J 2.1.0
            http://www.gecode.org/gecodej/

and

                   Gecode/FlatZInc 1.2
            http://www.gecode.org/flatzinc.html

Both Gecode/J and Gecode/FlatZinc have been updated to work with  
Gecode 2.1.0.

On our web site, you will find source packages as well as binary  
packages for Windows and Mac OS X.

Cheers,

	Guido

Subject: [gecode-users] Experimental Gist - Graphical Interactive Search Tool
Message-ID: <AC17EF1C-7949-430B-9779-9B0381A5F1E3@ps.uni-sb.de>

Hi everyone!

Today's release of Gecode 2.1.0 contains a new tool, the Graphical  
Interactive Search Tool (Gist).  It is not enabled by default, and  
still beta quality, but should be quite useable and useful already.

If you want to try it out, get a copy of the GPL version of  
Trolltech's Qt toolkit (from http://www.trolltech.com), and configure  
Gecode with the option --enable-gist.  To get an idea of what you can  
do with Gist, just run one of our examples with the new mode option,  
e.g.:

./examples/queens -mode gist

We hope you find this addition as useful as we do, and we're happy to  
receive feedback on it!

Cheers,
	Guido

Subject: [gecode-users] Only showing solutions without ".."
Message-ID: <a6b4b44a0802290742pc6d211ewf9cfca16ef33a78b@mail.gmail.com>

Hello,
I would like to know.
How can I tell gecode, when using sets,
that show me only the solutions not
containing ".."


For example, I would like to see
solutions such as: {0,4,6,7,9,11}#(6) or new polygon{0,4,6,7,9,10}#(6)
But I do not want to see this kind of solutions:
new polygon{0,4,7..10}#(6)
new polygon{0,4,7..9,11}#(6)
new polygon{0,4,7,8,10,11}#(6)
new polygon{0,4,7,9..11}#(6)

Please contact me, if somebody have any clues

Thanks

The set {0,4,7..10}#(6) actually means {0,4,7,8,9,10}, Gecode always  
outputs continuous intervals using .. notation.  If you want to have  
individual values, you can e.g. use a GlbValues iterator on a SetVar.

Cheers,
	Guido

As a is {1,2,3,4,5} and b is {3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10}, the difference is  
{1,2}, and answers should be constrained to two sets answers[0] and  
answers[1] such that their union is {1,2}.  What exactly is your  
question?

Guido

Hello,
I made the difference. There was a bug in other part of the code.
But the problem with the ".." representation is that I am getting
too many solutions representing the same, such as:
(1,2..5)
(1,2,3..5)
(1,2,3,4,5)

and I just want to get (1,2,3,4,5).

What can I do ?

thanks

I'm not sure I can follow you.  Does Gecode sometimes output {1,2..5}  
and sometimes {1,2,3..5}?  Or do you get two solutions where a certain  
set has the same value, and you only care about solutions that give  
you "new" sets?
