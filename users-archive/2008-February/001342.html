                     14th International Conference
                                  on
           Principles and Practice of Constraint Programming

      Sydney,  Australia                     14-18 September 2008

                 <A HREF="http://www.csse.unimelb.edu.au/cp2008/">http://www.csse.unimelb.edu.au/cp2008/</A>

     Co-located with:
     Int'l Conference on Automated Planning and Scheduling (ICAPS)
     Int'l Conference on Knowledge Representation and Reasoning (KR)
     Int'l Workshop on Nonmonotonic Reasoning (NMR)


____ Call for Application Papers ____

   The CP conference is the annual international conference on
   constraint programming.  It is concerned with all aspects of
   computing with constraints.

   CP 2008 wishes to promote the presentation of CP applications.
   Reports on successful applications of constraint technology are
   therefore particularly encouraged.  They are subject to special
   Applications track reviewing and acceptance criteria:

    -  Application papers will be reviewed by a special committee of
       people with much experience in the use of CP in applications.

    -  The writing of the paper itself is made simple by framing it
       around the answers to four main questions (outlined below).

   Accepted application papers will appear in the same proceedings as
   research papers, which will be published by Springer Verlag in the
   Lecture Notes in Computer Science series.  Papers are limited to 15
   LNCS pages.  Further author information is provided on the
   conference webpage.


____ Suggested outline ____

   Title

   Authors/Company

   Section 1: The problem
    - context, description, definition...
    - size of the application (constraint part/others)?
    - how important is the problem?  (impact...)
      in which terms?  (monetary, safety, etc.)
    - what is a solution to this  problem? (decision, exemplification,
      enumeration, counting, optimisation, approximation, etc.)

   Section 2. Why CP?
    - what was used before?  (hand made, LP...)
      why change?  (didn't it work well?  difficult to maintain? ...)
      why/how did you come to CP?

   Section 3. How CP?
    - model, implementation
    - pure CP or hybrid?  (is CP used in conjunction with other
      problem solving techniques such as LP/MIP, SAT, custom
      heuristic?)  which decomposition method?

   Section 4. Added value of CP?
    - cost of development? / time spent developing the application?
    - how long has it been in production mode (if development
      completed)?
    - what is the feedback from user experience (if applicable)?
    - was it difficult/necessary for the end-user to understand
      constraint technology?
    - what is the return on investment (if applicable)?
    - do you plan any new CP based development?
    - what are the lessons learned from the use of CP?
