Invoking propagation can be done using the status()-member of a Space.
This should not be done in the commit of a branching however, since
commit should only do what is described by the BranchingDesc that it
gets.

Constructing branching descriptions with a single alternative should
be what you are looking for. This is the approach taken by the
assignment branchings in gecode [1].

Message-ID: <a6b4b44a0801040515t1d935f81hecf4e246386bd8b4@mail.gmail.com>

Hello,

I am  interested in porting the Gecode Lisp interface (GECOL)
which currently supports Gecode 1.3.1 to Gecode 2.0.0.

I looked at the changelog, but I was wondering where can I
find more information about the differences between Gecode 1.3.1
and Gecode 2.0.0 which can be helpful for upgrading the Lisp Interface.

Additionally I would like to know about the experiences of
other programers who are working/worked porting their Gecode interfaces
to Gecode 2.0.0 (Java, Oz, Ruby, etc)

Thank you very much

Hello all,

How can I port this functions to gecode 2.0.0?
Does anybody has a clue?

Gecode::eq

Gecode::gcc

When I try compiling those with Gecode 2.0.0 I got
error: 'eq' is not a member of 'Gecode'
error: 'gcc' is not a member of 'Gecode'

Gecode::distinct

I got this error:

 gecol131/glue.cpp:1428: error: no matching function for call to
'distinct(Gecode::Space*&, Gecode::SetVarArgs&, unsigned int&)'

Thank you very much

Use Gecode::rel instead:
http://www.gecode.org/gecode-doc-latest/group__TaskModelIntRelInt.html
http://www.gecode.org/gecode-doc-latest/group__TaskModelIntRelBool.html

> Gecode::gcc

It's been renamed to count, and the interface has changed:
http://www.gecode.org/gecode-doc-latest/group__TaskModelIntCard.html

distinct has been removed as it was buggy. Just use a binary  
decomposition instead.

Message-ID: <a6b4b44a0801041251x6ae0b466v65b11a1819b2d4a6@mail.gmail.com>

Hello,

I looked at
http://www.gecode.org/gecode-doc-latest/group__TaskModelIntRelBool.html
and it was very helpful, but I could not find how to port the function
bool_not

void bool_not_boolvar_boolvar_intconlevel(Space *home, BoolVar *b0, BoolVar
*b1, IntConLevel icl)
{
   Gecode::bool_not(home, *b0, *b1, icl); --> it was used this way on gecode
1.3.1
}

BOT_NOT is not declared, as BOT_AND, BOT_OR, etc.

In the other hand, this works fine:

//Gecode::bool_and(home, *b0, *b1, *b2, icl); --> it was used this way on
gecode 1.3.1
  Gecode::rel(home,*b0, BOT_AND, *b1, *b2, icl,pk);

But, I can not find an equivalent function for this one: (notice that b2
type is bool)

void bool_and_boolvar_boolvar_bool_intconlevel(Space *home, BoolVar *b0,
BoolVar *b1, bool b2, IntConLevel icl,PropKind pk=PK_DEF)
{
   Gecode::bool_and(home, *b0, *b1, b2, icl);  --> it was used this way on
gecode 1.3.1
  // ???
}

Thank you very much

You can use IRT_NQ.

There is
Gecode::rel (Space *home, BoolVar x0, BoolOpType o, BoolVar x1, int n,  
IntConLevel icl=ICL_DEF,PropKind pk=PK_DEF)
Just use 0 for false and 1 for true as usual (implicit casts should do  
it automatically).

Message-ID: <34d172b40801091311v5685d956p5d83ca4445fd88e5@mail.gmail.com>

Hello all

I've been using Gecode for several months, and this is my first e-mail to
the users list.
First I want to say congratulations  to Christian Schulte , Mikael
Lagerkvist, Gido Tack , and all the people that work on gecode.  You've done
a nice job!.

Second I have a question about how to post a constraint, here is the
problem:

There are two IntVarArray :

IntVarArray a(this, size, 0 ,size)
IntVarArray b(this, size, 0 ,size)

I need to post a constraint over the var b[a[i]] for all i between 0 and
size. (I know I can do this using Arguments, and Element),

but what if I need to post that constraint over b[a[i] only when a[i]<4 and
another constraint when a[i]>=4?

I've been trying to figure out how to do this but I cant find an answer, do
you have any ideas?.

thank you  for your help.

Hi Christian,

that's totally sufficient for sure! In my case I am using almost the 
latest 1.X anyway.. :)

about the versions.. I dont know if there is anybody out there who is 
still using 1.2.X so it is just a general thing, but weren't there many 
differences between 1.2.X and 1.3.X ? If so it may be usefull for 
further releases to leave e.g. 2.0.X on the server when you will switch 
to 2.1.0 (far in future.. :) ). But as you already said, it depends on 
the changes that lead from 2.0.X to 2.1.0 .

Looking forward for a 1.X docu! :) Thanks a lot for enabling this!

Martin

Message-ID: <53628.132.230.129.10.1199975892.squirrel@webmail.informatik.uni-freiburg.de>

Hey,
i have recently imigrated to gecode 2.0 and i foud the following problem:
There is no refied version for the function :
void Gecode::linear  	(   	Space *   	 home,
		const IntArgs &  	a,
		const BoolVarArgs &  	x,
		IntRelType  	r,
		int  	y,
		IntConLevel  	icl = ICL_DEF,
		PropKind  	pk = PK_DEF
	)
or:
void Gecode::linear  	(   	Space *   	 home,
		const IntArgs &  	a,
		const BoolVarArgs &  	x,
		IntRelType  	r,
		IntVar  	y,
		IntConLevel  	icl = ICL_DEF,
		PropKind  	pk = PK_DEF
	)
While thie problem is not exited for the version of this function that
deals with IntVar because the function :
void Gecode::linear  	(   	Space *   	 home,
		const IntArgs &  	a,
		const IntVarArgs &  	x,
		IntRelType  	r,
		int 	y,
		BoolVar  	b,
		IntConLevel  	icl = ICL_DEF,
		PropKind  	pk = PK_DEF
	)
is already exited.
So if my variables are BoolVarArgs the only way to deal with this is to
convert to IntVar (and the assignment"=" is not available) so the only way
to do it is to use the following trick:
//
BoolVarArgs convertToIntVar(1);
convertToIntVar[0]=BoolVarToConvert;
linear(this, convertToIntVar, IRT_EQ,IntVarToBeConverted);
//
So is it possible to add refied version of the
void Gecode::linear(Space *,const IntArgs & ,const BoolVarArgs &
,IntRelType,int ,IntConLevel icl = ICL_DEF,PropKind pk = PK_DEF)

Best regards.

Hi,

That's actually a bug (or an omission) in Gecode 2.0.0. Apparently we missed
these variants. We will add them for Gecode 2.0.1 which will be available
very soon (together with Gecode/J 2.0.1).

In the mean time you can fix it very easily as follows: assume that a are
the IntArgs, x are the BoolVars. Then you can introduce a new variable z
that will be the sum of a*x. Then you reify just wrt z with rel. So the
following definition should do the trick:

using namespace Gecode;
void linear(Space* home, const IntArgs& a, const BoolVarArgs& x, IntRelType
r, int y) {
  IntVar z(home,Limits::Int::int_min,Limits::Int::int_max);
  linear(home,a,x,IRT_EQ,z);
  rel(home,z,r,y);
}
	
Cheers
Christian

Subject: [gecode-users] Question about gecode2

Hey,
i have recently imigrated to gecode 2.0 and i foud the following problem:
There is no refied version for the function :
void Gecode::linear  	(   	Space *   	 home,
		const IntArgs &  	a,
		const BoolVarArgs &  	x,
		IntRelType  	r,
		int  	y,
		IntConLevel  	icl = ICL_DEF,
		PropKind  	pk = PK_DEF
	)
or:
void Gecode::linear  	(   	Space *   	 home,
		const IntArgs &  	a,
		const BoolVarArgs &  	x,
		IntRelType  	r,
		IntVar  	y,
		IntConLevel  	icl = ICL_DEF,
		PropKind  	pk = PK_DEF
	)
While thie problem is not exited for the version of this function that
deals with IntVar because the function :
void Gecode::linear  	(   	Space *   	 home,
		const IntArgs &  	a,
		const IntVarArgs &  	x,
		IntRelType  	r,
		int 	y,
		BoolVar  	b,
		IntConLevel  	icl = ICL_DEF,
		PropKind  	pk = PK_DEF
	)
is already exited.
So if my variables are BoolVarArgs the only way to deal with this is to
convert to IntVar (and the assignment"=" is not available) so the only way
to do it is to use the following trick:
//
BoolVarArgs convertToIntVar(1);
convertToIntVar[0]=BoolVarToConvert;
linear(this, convertToIntVar, IRT_EQ,IntVarToBeConverted);
//
So is it possible to add refied version of the
void Gecode::linear(Space *,const IntArgs & ,const BoolVarArgs &
,IntRelType,int ,IntConLevel icl = ICL_DEF,PropKind pk = PK_DEF)

Best regards.

Uuups, that's of course nonsense. It should read:

using namespace Gecode;
void linear(Space* home, const IntArgs& a, const BoolVarArgs& x, IntRelType
r, int y,
            BoolVar b) {
  IntVar z(home,Limits::Int::int_min,Limits::Int::int_max);
  linear(home,a,x,IRT_EQ,z);
  rel(home,z,r,y,b);
}

Sorry

Unfortunately, your version is very, very inefficient. It creates a
propagator for each Boolean variable, if I understand correctly.

BTW: channeling between a Boolean variable and an integer is of course
available (so you should not use linear for that). It is called channel:
	
http://www.gecode.org/gecode-doc-latest/group__TaskModelIntChannel.html

Even more convenient is the function channel in the MiniModel module:

Message-ID: <D46720EC-5E48-4560-9C54-B964CAEFB817@cse.unsw.edu.au>

I have a question about optimisation. Say I have a constraint system  
and I'm trying to minimise the value of some variable X. As I  
understand it, the usual approach is to iteratively find a solution  
with X = x1, then add the constraint X < x1 and repeat until no more  
solutions can be found. Is this correct?

It occurs to me that each iteration only makes the problem more  
constrained, so assignments which failed in one iteration will  
continue to fail in all subsequent iterations. Is there any standard  
way to make use of this information to prune the search?

Yes, this is one usual way, even though there variations thereof and
simply other methods. For example, you may simply take X as the first
variable for distribution, starting from lower values.

Well, what you say is correct and there are systems (Mozart -
www.mozart-oz.org - which heavily influenced gecode) which do exactly
that. I am pretty sure gecode applies similar concepts, which are
organized around the basic notion of spaces (class Space). Suppose you
have a stage in solving you think is "reusable". Any such stage of a CSP
will be realized as a Space instance encapsulating all current basic
constraints and propagators. So what is usually done is: instead of
injecting a new distribution constraint directly into the reusable Space
S, what is usually done is (i) create a clone S' of S (that's what
Space::clone is for) and (ii) inject the new constraints into S' (or S)
and save S (or S') for later.

I am sure Gecode's optimization primitives incorporate these ideas to
avoid recomputation. However, cloning may be an expensive operation, so a
controlled amount of recomputation is sometimes desirable.

Cheers,

Jorge.

Yes, that's correct.

There is, it's called branch-and-bound search:  When you find a  
solution X = x1, add X < x1 to all "open nodes" in the search tree,  
and go on searching from the last solution you found.  The simpler  
alternative is to restart from the root node with the added constraint  
X < x1.  Both search engines are implemented in Gecode (called BAB and  
Restart).

However, the overhead caused by restart is sometimes not as big as one  
could think.  First of all, if the added constraint is strong enough,  
only few states that were already explored will be explored again.   
Second, the hard part of optimization is typically proving  
optimality.  I.e., you arrive at the optimal solution relatively  
quickly, but then you have to explore the remaining (huge) tree which  
is completely failed in order to prove optimality.  This phase is the  
same for both BAB and Restart, so the advantage of BAB only pays off  
in the first phase when you still find solutions.

Cheers,
	Guido

Gentle gecode users:

I have a virgin machine on which I am attempting to load gecode.  Because it 
is a virgin, beautiful as it is, I downloaded a new cygwin installation, so 
it has the latest everything.  Downloading gecode and doing .configure, 
everything went splendidly.  When I did a make, I got a g++ compile error on 
ranges-diff.icc --- the goto statement at line 94 gave me one of those 
strange C++ errors that you are branching to a label in a wrong dimension, 
or whatever they want to say.  I got that to work by putting a loop around 
the whole thing, moving the label down to the bottom of the loop, and 
sticking a nonsense statement after the loop.  Fine.

Now, when it gets to the final load statement of examples/bacp.exe, I am 
getting ten thousand undefined reference statements in 
minimodel/bool-expr.cc and int/var/bool.icc.  Most of these are of BoolVars 
of various sorts.  Those I *don't* know what to do about.  I suppose having 
an example not load won't kill me, but I'd like to know what is going on.

Any assistance would be greatly appreciated.....

Dear David,

let me explain what happens here. I am a Cygwin user since a long time ;-(

 - The first thing you notice is that the gcc shipped with Cygwin rejects
legal code. We might fix that for the 
   next release, most likely (see below).
 - The other thing is a bug in Gecode 2.0.0 that has been fixed for 2.0.1
(it has to do with static linking, Guido is that true?).

But, actually, my recommendation is very simple: forget gcc on Cygwin as
there is no need whatsoever to use it.

As said, I use cygwin every day but together with the freely available
Express Edition of Microsoft's Visual C++ compiler. It works as follows:
download, install, set up the environment that cygwin can pick up the
necessary environment variables for the commandline version of the compiler
(easy, has been discussed before on this list) and then ./configure CC=cl
CXX=cl (the documentation discusses compiling for MSVC).

The benefits are enormous. Compilation is much much faster and so is the
generated code.

I stopped using gcc on cygwin completely as it is so outdated and any
improvement is not in sight. But I have to admit that even if a recent gcc
would be available on cygwin I still would use MSVC.

I am not even sure that we should waste any effort on hacking around gcc's
bugs under cygwin, maybe the best would be to just say on the documentation
what I said in this email and state clearly that gcc is not supported on
cygwin (as dynamic linking is broken anyway).

Would that be a hardship for any of the users?

Thanks for the feedback!
Christian

Hi Christian,

mhh.. I am using cygwin too. I encountered several problems by the old shipped gcc too but until now I was lucky and I got everything working. But I ve got to admit I ve not found the time to check gecode 2.X.

I my opinion it sounds a bit hard not to support cygwins gcc but I see the problems of course. With a fast look into the net I ve not found anybody with a proper working gcc 4.x in cygwin. :(
Anyway, a direct support of cygwin without the msvc compiler would be great if the effort is acceptable. Would be a step to complicate a gecode usage for poor windows users as I am and may stop some people to give gecode a try! And that would be a pitty! ;)

Anyway I will have to try the msvc compiler if you do such a strong suggestion! Hopefully the error output will be a bit more expressive.

Hope it helps,

Martin

Martin,

I will be using Gecode rather than Gecode/J for teaching this year (as a
much better C++-based Gist is coming up and modeling in C++ is easier than
in Java). I will insist that students use MSVC! That is also for the reason
that they will be using Gecode precompiled binaries under Windows - which
are compiled with MSVC. Compiling the graphics package (Qt) with the cygwin
gcc is out of question.

What we could do is to put a bash snippet up that sets the environment
variables correctly. Otherwise installation is a piece of cake! A quick and
dirty one I use for MSVC EE 2008 is below (I am pretty sure that one can do
something that reads the MSVC batch file instead easily).

Let me reiterate. Please consider using MSVC, it is so much more fun to use!
Any compiler has its quirks (so has MSVC) for sure but for me the old cygwin
gcc is completely out of question for Gecode.

Another option might be pure MINGW but I haven't checked that (neither will
I).

Cheers
Christian

I changed Iter::Ranges::Diff so that it compiles with cygwin's gcc.   
This will be part of Gecode 2.0.1.

There was one bug causing problems with static linking that I had  
already fixed, but I found another today. Both are fixed in the trunk  
version of Gecode, and the fixes will be part of 2.0.1.

Cheers,
	Guido

Hi,

if you insist on using gcc with cygwin, you should consider the "-mno- 
cygwin" option.  Otherwise, Gecode will link against the cygwin  
libraries instead of the Windows libraries, and the resulting  
executable is terribly slow.  I think it has something to do with the  
memory management in the cygwin libraries.

Cheers,
	Guido

Message-ID: <0BD7838A-DC0A-4542-9C1F-D8BAAD8FFA00@ps.uni-sb.de>

Hi.

I looked into the problems with gcc and dlls on Windows a little more  
closely, and I'm afraid it's too broken for a reasonable workaround.   
While we have a solution for one linking problem (export of vtables),  
another problem is more serious: gcc screws up non-inline template  
functions that are used across dll borders.  The only option would be  
to make those functions inline, which we don't want to do (we try to  
be careful about what is declared inline and what is not!).

So, for the time being, gcc/cygwin will only produce static libraries,  
and you'll have to resort to msvc if you need dlls.

Cheers,
	Guido

  CP 2008 includes a technical program, where presentations of research and
  application papers as well as invited talks aim at describing the best
  results and techniques in the state-of-the-art of constraint programming.
  Two days of workshops, tutorials and the Doctoral Program will precede
  the conference.

  Papers are solicited from all disciplines concerned with constraints.
  Reports on successful applications of constraint technology are
  particularly encouraged and are subject to special Applications track
  acceptance criteria.  Submitted papers must be original and must not be
  simultaneously submitted for publication in a journal or another
  conference.  The conference proceedings are expected to be published by
  Springer Verlag in the Lecture Notes in Computer Science series.  Papers
  are limited to 15 LNCS pages.  Further author information will be
  provided on the conference webpage.

Christian, thank you for your time in writing.  I have downloaded the MSVC 
as you suggested, and am one frustrated puppy (as described below) which is 
why this Email is late.  You wrote:

Very well.  I am a believer!  I downloaded MSVC, and installed it.  Full of 
confidence, I run .configure CC=cl CXX=cl.

It fails.

Why does it fail?  Cygwin cannot find cl.  Ah, but the installation of MSVC 
went perfectly.  Why can cygwin not find cl, I ask?  I start up a command 
shell.  The cmd command shell cannot find cl either.  Something is amiss!  I 
start up their fancy user interface.  It has a tool for starting up a Visual 
C++ command shell.  I do so, which looks like an ordinary command window. 
Surprise!  It finds cl just fine.  I examine its path.  It has a bunch of 
extra things on its path that the ordinary path does not.  I place these on 
the default path.  Now cygwin can find cl.  Success, I think.

But I'm wrong.

Now .configure still fails, because cl cannot find the standard libraries 
(specifically, it fails on LIBCMT.LIB).  Somehow the environment variables 
(or something or other) is still not set correctly.  Only this time it is 
not as obvious as the path, but is some variable (or something or other) 
that I know not of, and therefore cannot check.

Obviously, this is a new version of MSVC.  I cannot find where they will 
allow me to download an old version, or what I can do to avoid the lovely 
paternalistic Microsoft setting of environment variables (or something or 
other) that disallows batch routines outside of their little environment.

Is there something I can do to address this situation?

Have I mentioned this has added to my dislike of Microsoft?  Even when it 
gives out free software?

Dear David,

It's not that hard. Either do as I said in one of my previous mails (copied
again below) or do as discussed earlier on this list:
	- start up the commandline thing that comes with MSVC (it has a
separate entry in your start menu)
	- then from that start bash (goto the Cygwin\bin dir then start
bash.exe)

Or, if you like neither, edit the cygwin.bat file so that it includes the
vcvars32.bat file from the MSVC distro.

The catch is that setting the PATH is not sufficient, you need much more
than that, please see below.

Christian

Subject: [gecode-users] "nvalues" global constraint
Message-ID: <AEA2A7B7-7F94-4418-ABC3-4C0207445B30@laposte.net>

Hi !

Is there an implementation of the nvalues global constraint in  
Gecode ? (This constraint is used to specify the number of different  
values in an array of variables, and described in the Global  
constraint catalog here : http://www.emn.fr/x-info/sdemasse/gccat/ 
sec5.186.html )

I searched in he documentation but have not found it...

Cheers,

J?r?mie

No, we don't have it yet.  You can emulate it using set constraints.  
Here's the pseudo code:

IntVarArgs x;
SetVar y;
IntVar n;
rel(home, SOT_UNION, x, y);
cardinality(home, y, n);

The variable n is now equal to the number of different values in x.   
If the number of values is fixed, you can of course use a constant  
cardinality for y instead.  This decomposition certainly doesn't  
achieve domain consistency, but it should work.

Cheers,
	Guido

Dear One, 
     
I am Barr. Larry Marck from London and Personal Attorney to Mr. Neal  Marzouk A National of your country, who was a contractor with an oil  company in Holland the Netherlands.Unfortunately, My client and his  family was involved in air crash,Egypt Air Flight 990, which crashed  into the Atlantic Ocean on October 31, 1999. All occupants of the plane  unfortunately lost their lives. Since then I have made several inquires  to your Embassy to locate any of my clients extended Relatives but this  has also proved unsuccessful.
     
After these several unsuccessful attempts, I decided to track his last  name over the Internet, to locate any member of his family hence I  contacted you. I have contacted you to assist me in repatriating the  money and property left behind by my client before they get confiscated  or declared unserviceable by the Finance company where these huge  deposits were lodged for safe keeping. Particularly, the Finance Company  where the deceased had an account valued at about (US$11.6m) Eleven  Million, Six Hundred Thousand United States Dollars only, has issued me  a notice to provide the Next of Kin or have the Account confiscated  within the next 21 working days.
     
Since I have been unsuccessful in locating the relatives for over months  now, I seek your consent to present you as the next of kin of the  deceased since you have the same last name with him, so that this  account valued at (US$11.6m) Can be paid to you and then we can share  the money for onward investment in your country, all necessary legal  documents will be made in your name to back up the claim of this fund in  the Finance company.All I require is your honest cooperation to enable  us see this transaction through.I guaranteed that this will be executed  under a legitimate arrangement that will protect you from any breach of  the law.Please do get in touch with me through my personal email address  for more details, once I have your consent and trust then we can proceed  immediately.
     
Your anticipated response is urgently needed. I will finally like to  receive your mobile numbers for easier communication, also your resident  address for the documentation in your name as the beneficiary.I await an  urgent attention to this mail [barr.larrymarck2008 at hotmail.com]

I attach a script raising the bug and a "temptative" of a patch for the file

Hi Mauricio,

from time to time I encountered some linker problems with g++ due to the ordering of the libraries to link. (I am not sure if I did static or dynamic linking)
check: http://www.network-theory.co.uk/docs/gccintro/gccintro_18.html

Maybe that's the case here too. Check your ordering of the gecode libs - in general the opposite order of the includes.
Think e.g. -lgecodekernel has to be the last one not the second.

Hope it may work but further information is neccessary as Christian said.

Order is one aspect (but AFAIK only for static libs).  But your  
problem is that you didn't link libgecodesupport (which is new in  
2.0.0), that should be the library that contains the vtable for  
Exception.

Cheers,
	Guido

Hello all,



I am having this problem compiling with gecode 2.0.0.
I am compiling under Mac OS X Leopard for Intel.
What other information should I provide?

is very weird and uncommon, somebody knows what could be?

Dear Stefano,

thanks so much! That was a shameful bug, my brain must have been off when I did that. I cannot even reconstruct what this nonsense should do. The fix is good and will be in the next release.

Christian

PS: That means we should also test search more thoroughly not only propagation.

Hi,
I think there is a small bug in the LDS search engine (not sure I am using it properly).

I attach a script raising the bug and a "temptative" of a patch for the file lds.cc, but I am not sure is correct...

Dear Christian,
well, I have been working a bit more on LDS... my suggestion is more  
a work-around than a fix.
I have noticed one more thing:

- when solving the example I sent you with max discrepancy equal to  
1000, we get 1999 fails!
Altough, we should get the same number of fails of using DFS, since  
it is just visiting the same tree with a different order...

I did try to get trough the Gecode sources but, so far, I have not  
succeed in fixing it.

Thus, I have tried to figure out how to implement LDS by my own, and  
I have just realized that LDS is exactly like DFS, but using a queue  
instead of a stack (see the attached examples). In that way, it is  
not necessary to use a max-discrepancy parameter when calling the  
search engine.  Do you agree?

thanks (a lot) in advance,
Stefano

This is a problem with gcc 3.4.  We have fixed (well, worked around)  
it in the trunk version of Gecode, and the fix will be part of the  
next release.  However, I would strongly suggest to use a more recent  
version of gcc, preferably 4.2!

If you really need to get it working with Gecode 2.0.0 (instead of the  
trunk) and the old gcc, you should get the file ranges-diff.icc from  
the trunk in our subversion repository and incorporate the changes  
into your version.

Cheers,
	Guido

You have to emulate it like this:

void rel_intset_setoptype_intset_setreltype_setvar(Space *home, const  
IntSet *x, SetOpType op, const IntSet *y, SetRelType r, SetVar *z)
{
  Gecode::IntSetRanges xr(*x);
  Gecode::IntSetRanges yr(*y);
  switch (op) {
  case SOT_INTER:
    {
        Gecode::Iter::Ranges::Inter< Gecode::IntSetRanges,  
Gecode::IntSetRanges > ir(xr,yr);
        Gecode::IntSet result(ir);
        Gecode::dom(home, *z, inverse(r), ir);
    }
    break;
  case SOT_UNION:
    ...
  }
  case ...
  }
}

Where inverse(r) is pseudo-code for inverting the relation (SRT_SUB <- 
 > SRT_SUP).

We'll add support for things like this to the minimodel layer, but we  
removed it from the main library because it is really just a modeling  
help.

Cheers,
	Guido

Hello,
Thank you very much. I am going to look at your answers.

I am starting a new branch of gecol (gecode interface for lisp)
in order to make it work with Gecode 2.0.0.

It has support for finite domain and some functions of finite set.
If there is anyone interested in working on this project please
contact me. We are needing all the help available.

Message-ID: <C19C11A3-3216-4C23-B4BD-8E37C69C2440@hszk.bme.hu>

Hello,

at the Budapest University of Technology and Economics we are planning  
to use Gecode/J for a new project. We are currently exploring it.

As we looked at the homepage, we saw that a new version of Gecode was  
released in November, and I read in the gecode-users archive, that the  
porting of Gecode/J has began.

I would like to know whether you suggest waiting for the new version  
(or at least using the svn version), or is it better to start on with  
Gecode 1.3.1 and Gecode/J 1.0.1? Some of the new Gecode features does  
look promising, and the more efficient constraint solving comes always  
in good stead.

Thank you very much for your help

Hi Stefano,

The number of fails can be higher as LDS might explore the same parts of the
tree more than once (You probe the tree several times with increasing max
discrepancy). The details I have to check again.

Your second observation I do not really buy into: when you turn a stack into
a queue you get BFS but not LDS! LDS is really unique in that it iterates
probes with an increasing number of discrepancies allowed.

Cheers
Christian

The new version is really coming soon, the only thing left is to fix a bug
in search found by Stefano in Gecode and test Gecode/J. Otherwise we are
done.

So if you have one week/two weeks to wait then go for 2.0.1. Otherwise go
for 1.3.1 (which is also a good system...)

Subject: [gecode-users] New Gecode/J

Hello,

at the Budapest University of Technology and Economics we are planning  
to use Gecode/J for a new project. We are currently exploring it.

As we looked at the homepage, we saw that a new version of Gecode was  
released in November, and I read in the gecode-users archive, that the  
porting of Gecode/J has began.

I would like to know whether you suggest waiting for the new version  
(or at least using the svn version), or is it better to start on with  
Gecode 1.3.1 and Gecode/J 1.0.1? Some of the new Gecode features does  
look promising, and the more efficient constraint solving comes always  
in good stead.

Thank you very much for your help

Zolt?n Ujhelyi

Subject: [gecode-users] Gecode trunk fix for Cygwin g++ compilation
Message-ID: <479DD8B4.50005@informatik.uni-freiburg.de>


Hi,

I know the Gecode trunk is not meant to be stable. But I encountered 
some problems that might occure in the next release too.

================================
  My setup :
================================
   WinXP
   Cygwin
   g++ (GCC) 3.4.4
   aclocal, automake 1.1.0
   autoconf 2.61
================================
./configure
  --enable-static --disable-shared
  --disable-set-vars --disable-cpltset-vars
  --disable-gist --disable-qt
  --without-boost
================================


1) the current 'configure' has some Windows line breaks with '\r' and a 
"dos2unix" was necessary

2) your AC_CONFIG_FILES statement at the end of configure.ac doesnt work 
properly on my system. I get the following:

================================
configure: creating ./config.status
./config.status --file Makefile:Makefile.in
config.status: creating Makefile
================================

Obviously all remaining files in AC_CONFIG_FILES are not created from 
their *.in files (e.g. config.hh) and I get the expected error when 
calling make:

================================
make[1]: Entering directory `/cygdrive/e/Research/CPP/Gecode-trunk'
make[1]: >>gecode/kernel/var-type.icc<< ist bereits aktualisiert.
make[1]: >>gecode/kernel/var-imp.icc<< ist bereits aktualisiert.
make[1]: >>gecode/kernel/var-type.cc<< ist bereits aktualisiert.
make[1]: *** Keine Regel vorhanden, um das Target >>gecode/config.hh<<,
   ben"otigt von >>gecode/support/exception.o<<, zu erstellen.  Schluss.
make[1]: Leaving directory `/cygdrive/e/Research/CPP/Gecode-trunk'
make: *** [compilelib] Fehler 2
================================

I fixed it by replacing the following lines

 >>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>
AC_CONFIG_FILES([Makefile doxygen.conf:doxygen/doxygen.conf.in
    doxygen.hh:doxygen/doxygen.hh.in
    misc/gecode.pc misc/gecode-search.pc misc/gecode-serialization.pc
    misc/gecode-minimodel.pc])
 >>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>
<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<
AC_CONFIG_FILES([Makefile ])
AC_CONFIG_FILES([doxygen.conf:doxygen/doxygen.conf.in])
AC_CONFIG_FILES([doxygen.hh:doxygen/doxygen.hh.in])
AC_CONFIG_FILES([misc/gecode.pc misc/gecode-search.pc])
AC_CONFIG_FILES([misc/gecode-serialization.pc])
AC_CONFIG_FILES([misc/gecode-minimodel.pc])
<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<

Afterwards configure finishs as expected and make succeeds.

I am not sure if this is a problem of my (old) autoconf version or 
something else.

Just mentioning my experiences in case somebody else has a similar problem.

So far,

Martin

PS. @Christian: I've installed MSVC++ and will give it a try. ;) But the 
problem is that all my programs (distributed with their own automake 
scripts) have to support 'cl' and its flags too in order to use the MSVC 
compiled Gecode libraries. Or am I wrong about that and it is possible 
to link against these libs with g++ later? Would be surprising for me ..

Hi,

Interesting: I do develop under Cygwin with autoconf etc and haven't noticed
any of the quirks you mention. But thanks!

In principle, MinGW gcc should be able to link against MSVC (that's what
they say on their webpage). But as I haven't tried myself I do not know
whether this is true.

Cheers

Yes, I thought so too and was surprised to have these problems.

:) Ok, so as soon as I find some free time I will give it a try and 
report my results on that.

Thanks, Martin, I changed it accordingly.

No, your autoconf is recent enough, I use the same version.  I  
remember that we had similar problems in Alice.

Hi Christian,
I have read again the original papers on LDS (by Harvey&Ginsberg) and  
on Improved-LDS (by Korf).

My observation was half right, half wrong:

- half right: it is possible to implement DFS and LDS where the only  
implementation difference consists in using a simple-queue instead of  
a stack. I did in Oz last night, and if you like I can share the  
code. By implementing LDS in that way every node is visited exactly  
once, but unfortunately it requires exponential memory (worst case)  
for the queue... as BFS ...

- half wrong: it boils LDS down to a BFS-like search, that is, LDS  
could be implemented as a BFS (with a priority queue, instead of a  
queue) where the cost function of a node is its number of  
discrepancy, as suggested in the paper of Korf.

cheers,
Stefano

The version of LDS I use has the advantage that memory is limited by the
number of discrepancies made. That's not too bad, as discrepancies tend to
be small.

Emulating any search via priority queue is a cute model and works for some
cases but not here apparently...
