Yes, that's correct.

There is, it's called branch-and-bound search:  When you find a  
solution X = x1, add X &lt; x1 to all &quot;open nodes&quot; in the search tree,  
and go on searching from the last solution you found.  The simpler  
alternative is to restart from the root node with the added constraint  
X &lt; x1.  Both search engines are implemented in Gecode (called BAB and  
Restart).

However, the overhead caused by restart is sometimes not as big as one  
could think.  First of all, if the added constraint is strong enough,  
only few states that were already explored will be explored again.   
Second, the hard part of optimization is typically proving  
optimality.  I.e., you arrive at the optimal solution relatively  
quickly, but then you have to explore the remaining (huge) tree which  
is completely failed in order to prove optimality.  This phase is the  
same for both BAB and Restart, so the advantage of BAB only pays off  
in the first phase when you still find solutions.

Cheers,
	Guido
