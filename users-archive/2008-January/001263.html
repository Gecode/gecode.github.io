<PRE>Gentle gecode users:

I have a virgin machine on which I am attempting to load gecode.  Because it 
is a virgin, beautiful as it is, I downloaded a new cygwin installation, so 
it has the latest everything.  Downloading gecode and doing .configure, 
everything went splendidly.  When I did a make, I got a g++ compile error on 
ranges-diff.icc --- the goto statement at line 94 gave me one of those 
strange C++ errors that you are branching to a label in a wrong dimension, 
or whatever they want to say.  I got that to work by putting a loop around 
the whole thing, moving the label down to the bottom of the loop, and 
sticking a nonsense statement after the loop.  Fine.

Now, when it gets to the final load statement of examples/bacp.exe, I am 
getting ten thousand undefined reference statements in 
minimodel/bool-expr.cc and int/var/bool.icc.  Most of these are of BoolVars 
of various sorts.  Those I *don't* know what to do about.  I suppose having 
an example not load won't kill me, but I'd like to know what is going on.

Any assistance would be greatly appreciated.....
