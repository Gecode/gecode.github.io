<PRE>Dear David,

let me explain what happens here. I am a Cygwin user since a long time ;-(

 - The first thing you notice is that the gcc shipped with Cygwin rejects
legal code. We might fix that for the 
   next release, most likely (see below).
 - The other thing is a bug in Gecode 2.0.0 that has been fixed for 2.0.1
(it has to do with static linking, Guido is that true?).

But, actually, my recommendation is very simple: forget gcc on Cygwin as
there is no need whatsoever to use it.

As said, I use cygwin every day but together with the freely available
Express Edition of Microsoft's Visual C++ compiler. It works as follows:
download, install, set up the environment that cygwin can pick up the
necessary environment variables for the commandline version of the compiler
(easy, has been discussed before on this list) and then ./configure CC=cl
CXX=cl (the documentation discusses compiling for MSVC).

The benefits are enormous. Compilation is much much faster and so is the
generated code.

I stopped using gcc on cygwin completely as it is so outdated and any
improvement is not in sight. But I have to admit that even if a recent gcc
would be available on cygwin I still would use MSVC.

I am not even sure that we should waste any effort on hacking around gcc's
bugs under cygwin, maybe the best would be to just say on the documentation
what I said in this email and state clearly that gcc is not supported on
cygwin (as dynamic linking is broken anyway).

Would that be a hardship for any of the users?

Thanks for the feedback!
Christian

Subject: [gecode-users] Adventures in installation

Gentle gecode users:

I have a virgin machine on which I am attempting to load gecode.  Because it

is a virgin, beautiful as it is, I downloaded a new cygwin installation, so 
it has the latest everything.  Downloading gecode and doing .configure, 
everything went splendidly.  When I did a make, I got a g++ compile error on

ranges-diff.icc --- the goto statement at line 94 gave me one of those 
strange C++ errors that you are branching to a label in a wrong dimension, 
or whatever they want to say.  I got that to work by putting a loop around 
the whole thing, moving the label down to the bottom of the loop, and 
sticking a nonsense statement after the loop.  Fine.

Now, when it gets to the final load statement of examples/bacp.exe, I am 
getting ten thousand undefined reference statements in 
minimodel/bool-expr.cc and int/var/bool.icc.  Most of these are of BoolVars 
of various sorts.  Those I *don't* know what to do about.  I suppose having 
an example not load won't kill me, but I'd like to know what is going on.

Any assistance would be greatly appreciated.....
