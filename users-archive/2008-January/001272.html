<PRE>Dear David,

It's not that hard. Either do as I said in one of my previous mails (copied
again below) or do as discussed earlier on this list:
	- start up the commandline thing that comes with MSVC (it has a
separate entry in your start menu)
	- then from that start bash (goto the Cygwin\bin dir then start
bash.exe)

Or, if you like neither, edit the cygwin.bat file so that it includes the
vcvars32.bat file from the MSVC distro.

The catch is that setting the PATH is not sufficient, you need much more
than that, please see below.

Christian

Subject: Re: [gecode-users] Adventures in installation

Christian, thank you for your time in writing.  I have downloaded the MSVC 
as you suggested, and am one frustrated puppy (as described below) which is 
why this Email is late.  You wrote:

&gt;<i> As said, I use cygwin every day but together with the freely available
</I>&gt;<i> Express Edition of Microsoft's Visual C++ compiler. It works as follows:
</I>&gt;<i> download, install, set up the environment that cygwin can pick up the

</I>&gt;<i> (easy, has been discussed before on this list) and then ./configure CC=cl
</I>&gt;<i> CXX=cl (the documentation discusses compiling for MSVC).
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> The benefits are enormous. Compilation is much much faster and so is the

</I>
Very well.  I am a believer!  I downloaded MSVC, and installed it.  Full of 
confidence, I run .configure CC=cl CXX=cl.

It fails.

Why does it fail?  Cygwin cannot find cl.  Ah, but the installation of MSVC 
went perfectly.  Why can cygwin not find cl, I ask?  I start up a command 
shell.  The cmd command shell cannot find cl either.  Something is amiss!  I

start up their fancy user interface.  It has a tool for starting up a Visual

C++ command shell.  I do so, which looks like an ordinary command window. 
Surprise!  It finds cl just fine.  I examine its path.  It has a bunch of 
extra things on its path that the ordinary path does not.  I place these on 
the default path.  Now cygwin can find cl.  Success, I think.

But I'm wrong.

Now .configure still fails, because cl cannot find the standard libraries 
(specifically, it fails on LIBCMT.LIB).  Somehow the environment variables 
(or something or other) is still not set correctly.  Only this time it is 
not as obvious as the path, but is some variable (or something or other) 
that I know not of, and therefore cannot check.

Obviously, this is a new version of MSVC.  I cannot find where they will 
allow me to download an old version, or what I can do to avoid the lovely 
paternalistic Microsoft setting of environment variables (or something or 
other) that disallows batch routines outside of their little environment.

Is there something I can do to address this situation?

Have I mentioned this has added to my dislike of Microsoft?  Even when it 
gives out free software?
