Firstly, let me thank you for a fabulous tool and better support than  
any free software I've encountered before. Research software is not  
usually any near the quality of Gecode and you deserve high acclaim  
for your work.

As for improvements, in the short term I think the push to fill out  
the documentation is important. In the longer term, it would be good  
to see more visualisation and debugging tools. If you make an error in  
your constraint definitions, at the moment it is very difficult to  
detect and isolate the problem. It is also hard to visualise whether  
your constraint system is propagating and searching efficiently. It  
would be very nice to have a graphical way to watch the propagation of  
information around the constraint graph.

Like any programming language, there are good and bad ways of writing  
constraint systems. At the moment the modelling problem remains a  
black art, only really properly understood by a few. I think it will  
remain that way as long as constraint propagation remains a black box.  
Solving this may require a significant about of HCI work, but I think  
it would be very valuable in the long run.

Malcolm
