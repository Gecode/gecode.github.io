Let me ask again, please:  Does the solver really output these  
different representations of the same set??  I mean, do you just call  
Gecode's output function that writes a SetVar to an ostream, and that  
outputs sometimes (1,2,...,5) and sometimes (1,2,3,4,5)??

Well, that is a problem in your constraint model then.  If your model  
allows many different solutions where that particular set has the same  
value, then that's what the solver will return.  As I don't know your  
model, it's hard to tell what's wrong with it.

Message-ID: <367F4A86-A011-4EEA-9669-7BD3135D2C57@elet.polimi.it>

Hi,
Does the new release depend on a particular boost version?
So far, it compile only with serialization disabled (I am trying on  
both Linux and Mac OS X).

In 'configure' and 'gecode.m4' files there are references to  
boost-1_33_1 (see below).

This is the error on compilation:

g++ -I. -fvisibility=hidden -fPIC -Wextra -Wall -pipe -ggdb -fno-

boost-1_34_1  -c -o gecode/serialization/flatzinc.o  gecode/

We've had some problems with boost serialization (mainly due to  
unreadable error messages from template functions...), and haven't  
been able to resurrect it before the release.  I just fixed the most  
obvious things in the trunk (which had to do with interface changes  
within Gecode), but the code still doesn't compile.  I must admit that  
I don't fully understand all the details of boost serialization, and I  
just don't know what's wrong with the current code - the compiler  
complains about ambiguous overloading of an operator<< for the type  
boost::archive::version_type.
If you need boost serialization, it would be great if you could have a  
look at what's wrong there.  If you don't need it, please just compile  
without the --with-boost switch.

Cheers,
	Guido

It's the technique presented in this paper:

Message-ID: <E64C376A-FA03-4F83-8D4A-DAEAD76AFF19@hszk.bme.hu>

Hello,

I have two questions related to Gecode/J.

First: has the eq constraint filling method removed in version 2.1?  
Eclipse gives me a warning about it. If it is only moved or renamed,  
how is it accessible in the new version? (Of course if it is not  
available, I know, that the rel() method could be used instead of it).

Second: is it possible to get a look at which constraints cause  
failures? I would like to produce additional feedback to the output,  
but I need some information about the solution process. Is there any  
construct for this goal (e.g. a notification subsystem or something  
like that)?

Thank you for your help,
Zolt?n Ujhelyi

It's been removed, you should use rel now.

That's currently not possible at all.  It is also not very helpful  
most of the time, as the constraint that detected failure may have  
done so only because some other constraint restricted a variable  
domain in a way the user did not plan.  I.e., if your model is  
incorrect, it will most of the time not be the incorrect constraint  
that causes failure.

Hi,

I've fixed the problem with boost serialization, the trunk version  
compiles again.  I also changed the way configure looks for boost, you  
now have to give the path to the header files, so that the version is  
not hard-coded into configure any longer.

We will release Gecode 2.1.1 and Gecode/J 2.1.1 tomorrow, both 2.1.0  
versions had some minor flaws the we want to correct.  Thanks again  
for pointing this out!

Cheers,
	Guido

Hi all,

I've been trying to run some examples from the last version of gecode (2.1.0)
and I getting a segmentation fault running the partition example (with the
default parameter 32). but when I run the same problem with  size=21 I got
the following error:

partition(5531) malloc: *** error for object 0xd0f790: incorrect checksum
for freed object - object was probably modified after being freed.
*** set a breakpoint in malloc_error_break to debug


BTW, I'm running these examples with a macbook pro,  gcc version:
i686-apple-darwin9-gcc-4.0.1. I downloaded the last release from the
repository (i.e svn checkout .... /release-2.1.0) and I also compiled gecode
with debug.


Best regards,
Alejandro

I can reproduce the problems, but only with gcc 4.0.1.  With gcc 4.2  
(also on Mac OS), it works as expected.  We had several problems with  
gcc 4.0 and don't recommend it (e.g., some finite set propagators  
don't terminate).  However, I'll look into this more closely, maybe  
it's something else.

Cheers,

thanks a lot for your quickly answer, because I'm modifying some critical
parts of gecode to get some information during the propagation process and
it's very difficult to understand these problems (especially because on
linux, with gcc 4.1.3, I don't get the segmentation fault).

Best regards,
Alejandro

Hi,
How do I model if-then style constraints ? What I want to do is post 
constraints if a variable is assigned a particular value. For example 
say  I have variable set V { v1, v2, v3} and each of them has the domain 
{1,2,3}. what I want to achieve is
    if  v1== 2  then
         v2 !=1  /\  v3 !=3

I know I can do this using a custom propagator, but is there any other way ?

With regards

Use reification, that's clumsy but works. So, with minimodeling support it
should be something like (~ reifies a linear relation, && is conjunction,
imp is implication, and tt means that the statement must be true):
	post(home, tt(imp(~(v1 == 2),~(v2 != 1) && ~(v3 != 3)));
or directly:
	BoolVar b1(home,0,1), b2(home,0,1), b3(home,0,1), b23(home,0,1);
	rel(home, v1, IRT_EQ, 2, b1);
	rel(home, v2, IRT_NQ, 1, b2);
	rel(home, v3, IRT_NQ, 3, b3);
      rel(home, b2, BOT_AND, b3, b23);
	rel(home, b1, BOT_IMP, b23, 1);

Or check whether extensional constraints work for you.

         v2 !=1  /\  v3 !=3

I know I can do this using a custom propagator, but is there any other way ?

With regards

Subject: [gecode-users] Gecode 2.1.1, Gecode/J 2.1.1 released
Message-ID: <EE850C13-05B8-4472-A305-6099727441D2@ps.uni-sb.de>

We're sorry for the short release interval, but we have to announce  
the release of

                   Gecode 2.1.1
            http://www.gecode.org

This is a bug-fix only release. Bugs fixed include a serious bug in  
the kernel,
a Gist redraw bug on Windows, and making boost serialization compile  
again.
For the full list, please see the changelog on our web pages.

We also release

                   Gecode/J 2.1.1
            http://www.gecode.org/gecodej/

This is a bug-fix only release. The Gecode/J Gist could abort with an
uncaught C++ exception. Also, the generation of compressed html
documentation was fixed. For the full list, please see the
changelog on our web pages.

On our web site, you will find source packages as well as binary
packages for Windows and Mac OS X. We provide additional binary packages
that include the experimental Gecode Gist (Graphical Interactive
Search Tool) module turned on.

Cheers,
	Guido

I've just tried to install Gecode 2.1.1 from the Mac OS dmg files  
(both with and without Qt) and in each case I got an "Install Failed"  
when the installation process was about 20% done. The message says  
"The source media you are installing from is damaged."

If I use reification like this, do I have to write my search code so  
that it instantiates all the booleans as well as all the 'normal'  
variables? Or can I rely on the fact that once all the 'normal'  
variables are instantiated all the booleans should also be instantiated.

So does it make sense to use Gecode.linear() on a VarArray<BoolVar> in  
2.10?

For all reified constraints that I can think of, instantiating the
"base" variables will also mean that the Boolean variable will get
instantiated. However, if you build more complicated expressions with
the Booleans and additional intermediate variables, then these might
not be instantiated. For example, think of the following constraint
system
    IntVar x;
    BoolVar IsA, IsB, Neither;
    x = a   <=>  IsA;
    x = b   <=>  IsB;
    IsA \/ IsB \/ Neither;
The variable Neither will not be instantiated if x is instantiated to
a or b (it can be either true or false, the constraints are satisfied
either way).

Cheers,
Mikael

If you can make sure that the values of the Booleans are determined by  
the values of the integer variables, you can exclude them from the  
branching.  But note that this requires careful reasoning: if not all  
the Booleans are determined automatically, the solver may not detect  
failure!

When I try to download it, everything works fine.  Could you please  
verify the md5 of the file?  It should read
MD5 (Downloads/Gecode-2.1.1.dmg) = db768db92ff0793f56eaa5d7f1948cc9

Otherwise, please give me some more details about the machine you  
tried it on (OS version, processor, etc).

Just call md5 on the downloaded file.  In the terminal, just type
md5 Downloads/Gecode-2.1.1.dmg

I've discovered that I can do what I want by posting BExprs anyway,  
and never have to create all those reified Booleans. Yay.

Using BExpr-constructions will create the Booleans in the background,
so you have to be extra careful that instantiating the input variables
is sufficient to determine whether the expresison succeeds or fails.
Otherwise, good luck.

Message-ID: <a6b4b44a0803100454w3be76967h4e3fba2a5a40e403@mail.gmail.com>

Hello,
I am trying to do a naive CCP ask in Gecode and
I am getting "Bus error".

The idea is doing this process inside a thread
ask (a = 1) do tell( b = 1)

I am doing it like this:

 while ( not root[i].assigned() ){ };
   if (root[i].val() == 1)
      rel(this, root[j], IRT_EQ, 1);

Any clues why I am getting "Bus error",

Thanks

Most probably because Gecode is quite simply not thread safe!  You  
cannot use the same space in two threads, concurrently performing  
operations on it (like propagation or querying of values).  Gecode was  
very consciously designed like this.  The only way multiple threads  
can safely access Gecode is if they operate on different spaces that  
have no shared data.

Cheers,
	Guido

Hi,

If you are using a Gecode Space in a concurrent setting, there are a
couple of things that you must observe.

First of all, a Space is not reentrant. Thus you must serialize all
accesses to the Space object.

Secondly, if you want to manipulate two different Spaces concurrently,
you must make sure that they do not share any data structures. This is
done by passing false as the share argument when cloning a Space.

Cheers,
Mikael

Hello all,
I am trying to use Gecode for make some ccp processes.
something like:

  when a = 1 do tell  b = 1
|| when b = 1 do tell c = 1
|| tell a = 1
|| when b = 1 and c = 1 do tell answer = true

with a,b,c all in the same intvararray (in the same space),
how can i make that?

thanks

Well, caution is always good but I have never come across an example where
Boolean variables obtained from reification needed extra labeling: typically
the reified expressions make some statement about the variables being
labeled and as Guido pointed out, as soon as all variables but the control
variable is assigned then the control variable will be assigned (that is
required of a reified propagator).

Using BExpr-constructions will create the Booleans in the background,
so you have to be extra careful that instantiating the input variables
is sufficient to determine whether the expresison succeeds or fails.
Otherwise, good luck.

What you can always do, is compute a fixpoint for a space (via status()) and
the find out.

Hello all,

 

I am trying to use Gecode for make some ccp processes.

something like:

 

  when a = 1 do tell  b = 1

|| when b = 1 do tell c = 1

|| tell a = 1

|| when b = 1 and c = 1 do tell answer = true

 

with a,b,c all in the same intvararray (in the same space),

how can i make that?

 

thanks

 

2008/3/10, Mikael Zayenz Lagerkvist <zayenz at gmail.com>:

Hi,

If you are using a Gecode Space in a concurrent setting, there are a
couple of things that you must observe.

First of all, a Space is not reentrant. Thus you must serialize all
accesses to the Space object.

Secondly, if you want to manipulate two different Spaces concurrently,
you must make sure that they do not share any data structures. This is
done by passing false as the share argument when cloning a Space.

Cheers,
Mikael

____ Call for Workshops ____

   The CP 2008 Program Committee invites proposals for the Workshop
   Program.

   CP 2008 workshops will provide an informal setting where workshop
   participants will have the opportunity to discuss specific
   technical topics in an atmosphere that facilitates the active
   exchange of ideas.  It is an opportunity to disseminate work in
   progress or to promote new and emerging areas within the field of
   constraints. The topics of the workshops can cover any area related
   to constraints and any related cross-disciplinary areas.  Workshops
   related to planning and scheduling are especially encouraged
   because of the co-location with ICAPS 2008.

   All workshops will take place during 14-15 September 2008 as
   pre-conference activities along tutorials and the doctoral program.

   Workshops can be half-day or full-day.  The internal format of the
   workshop will be determined by the organisers.

   Each workshop main organiser will be responsible for:

    - producing a "Call for Papers" and a web page for their workshop
      by 1 May 2008.  Please provide a web page/URL that can be linked
      into the CP 2008 home page.  The call must make it clear that
      the workshop is open to all members of the CP community.  It
      should also mention that at least one author of each accepted
      submission must attend the workshop.  Finally, it should also
      clearly describe the process by which the organising committee
      will select the participants.

    - providing a brief description of the workshop for the conference
      program.

    - selecting submitted papers; a list of accepted papers should be
      provided by 16 July 2008.

    - scheduling workshop activities in collaboration with the local
      organisers and the workshop chairs.

    - providing working notes to be duplicated for the workshop (up to
      a maximum of 200 pages) by 23 August 2008.

   The CP 2008 organising committee will be responsible for the
   following:

    - providing publicity for the workshop series as a whole.

    - providing logistics support and a meeting place for the
      workshop.

    - in conjunction with the organisers, determining the start and
      end times of the workshop.

    - duplicating working notes as described above and distributing
      them to the participants.

   All proposals should be submitted by electronic mail (in ASCII) to
   the Workshop Chair:

   application.  For example, the topics of tutorials in previous CP
   conferences include: symmetry-breaking, on-line stochastic
   optimisation, distributed constraints, problem modelling,
   preference representation, randomised backtracking, dynamic
   constraint programming, numerical CSPs, global constraints, soft
   constraints, mathematical programming, cooperation between methods,
   and areas of application (e.g. bioinformatics, configuration).

Hello Mr. Schulte,
I had many threads doing something like this:

//pthread start
 while ( not root[j+n].assigned() ){ gecode::status()};
  gecode::status();
  if (root[j+n].val() == 1)
      rel(this, root[i+n], IRT_EQ, 1);
//pthread end

But, since Gecode is not thread safe, I should
only have one thread asking if the variables are
assigned and calling the propagators, right?

Thank you very much,

Sorry for asking so much.

Mauricio

g++-4.2 -I. -DNDEBUG -fvisibility=hidden -fPIC -Wextra -Wall -pipe -ggdb -O3
-fno-strict-aliasing -finline-limit=3000 -ffast-math   \

I think I've a problem installing gcc 4.2 but I'm not sure about that, any
clue?


BTW:  my default compiler is i686-apple-darwin9-gcc-4.0.1 and I installed
i686-apple-darwin9-gcc-4.2.1. Finally I configured gecode with the following
characteristics

./configure --prefix=..... CC=g++-4.2 CXX=g++-4.2


Thanks in advance,
Alejandro

That's the problem, you're trying to compile a C source file with g+ 
+.  You should configure like this:

./configure --prefix=..... CC=gcc-4.2 CXX=g++-4.2

The observation to be made is that you always should first propagate to a
fixpoint and then perform the ask. While not incorrect (asks are monotonic)
it would be inefficient anyway. So one why would be to do it as follows:

-          Give a space a lock

-          In order to do propagation, the lock must be acquired and hence
remains locked

-          In order to do an ask, also the lock must be acquired, so there
are no issues with synchronization

 

Then, of course, remains the question whether one wants to use OS threads.
They are made for big computations and not tiny asks, so that might incur a
tremendous overhead.

 

Then, one other thing: you might want to avoid pthreads as they are not
fully portable. Please check the boost threads package for a portable and
efficient alternative.

 

Cheers

Christian

Hello Mr. Schulte,

 

I had many threads doing something like this:

 

//pthread start

 while ( not root[j+n].assigned() ){ gecode::status()};

  gecode::status(); 

  if (root[j+n].val() == 1) 

      rel(this, root[i+n], IRT_EQ, 1);

//pthread end

 

But, since Gecode is not thread safe, I should

only have one thread asking if the variables are

assigned and calling the propagators, right?

 

Thank you very much,

 

Sorry for asking so much.

 

Mauricio

What you can always do, is compute a fixpoint for a space (via status()) and
the find out.

Hello all,

 

I am trying to use Gecode for make some ccp processes.

something like:

 

  when a = 1 do tell  b = 1

|| when b = 1 do tell c = 1

|| tell a = 1

|| when b = 1 and c = 1 do tell answer = true

 

with a,b,c all in the same intvararray (in the same space),

how can i make that?

 

thanks

Hi,

If you are using a Gecode Space in a concurrent setting, there are a
couple of things that you must observe.

First of all, a Space is not reentrant. Thus you must serialize all
accesses to the Space object.

Secondly, if you want to manipulate two different Spaces concurrently,
you must make sure that they do not share any data structures. This is
done by passing false as the share argument when cloning a Space.

Cheers,
Mikael

____ Scope ____

  Bin Packing and Placement problems are an old but still challenging
  topic that has been tackled with different approaches.

  On the one hand, the aim of this workshop is to share recent progress
  made on pure problems by using any technique (or the mix) like Mixed
  Integer Linear Programming, Local Search, or Constraint Programming.

  On the other hand, the aim is to present challenging problems formulated
  and/or solved by these methods, or challenging extensions that have a
  practical interest and for which pure methods do not directly work.

  Submitted papers can be

       * Extended Abstracts of new results or
       * Abstract of ongoing works
       * Systems presentations (with demos at the workshop)
       * Summaries of already accepted or recently published results

  on any topic concerning bin packing and placement constraints.

Have a look at nonogram.cc or pentominoes.cc.

Depends on the language.  If you have things like term constructors /  
algebraic datatypes, just construct a term and then translate that  
into a REG on the C++ side.  If you can't do that, you could just have  
an array of triples (a,s,b) where a is the start state, s a symbol,  
and b the end state, and then turn that into a DFA on the C++ side.

Cheers,
	Guido

On a related question, does the distinct() constraint take into  
account the number of variables?

If I have three IntVars {X1, X2, X3} on a domain of two values {0,1}  
then to my mind the constraint distinct({X1, X2, X3}) should cause  
propagation failure immediately. In my present code this does not seem  
to be the case. Am I missing something?

I discovered the answer to my own question: I wasn't using a strong  
enough consistency. The default for distinct() is ICL_VAL. Setting it  
to ICL_BND did the trick.

I am building my own somewhat generic tracing for certain search

own tracing in a Branching::commit. This in itself is no problem but
now I would like to map the variable(s), on which tell operation(s)
will be executed in the commit, back to variables in for example an
array in my derived Space (for example the variable we execute a tell
on is the third variable in the array in my space). As the IntVar
instances have no identifier attributes this seems impossible. Am I
missing some possibilities?  And if I would like to add an identifier
attribute to for example an IntVar I should do this in IntVarImp?

I'm not sure I understand every detail of what you're trying to do,  
let me try to summarize: you have an array of IntVars in your space,  
and tracing means that you output what's happening during a commit.   
And of course you want to say something like "variable no. 3 was  
modified", where 3 is the index in the global array?
Our generic solution for this is a VarMap, which belongs to the new  
reflection API.  You can find a small tutorial on reflection here:
http://www.gecode.org/gecode-doc-latest/PageReflection.html

Hi,

May I ask that you add some simpler examples to the GecodeJ  
distribution, which do not use the Options class included? By being

Hi,

May I ask that you add some simpler examples to the GecodeJ  
distribution, which do not use the Options class included? By being  
able to handle all manner of different search types, the class loses  
its value as an example. It is hard to follow and difficult to see  
which bits are necessary and which bits are not. A bare-bones example  
would be useful. What is the minimum amount you need to create a  
problem and then solve it?

Thanks,

Hi,

this program has quite some flaws. Let me go through it:
 - posting distinct for x creates a propagator for the variables that are
currently stored in the array,
   changing the array later has no effect whatsoever.
 - x[0]=x1 in post is not what you mean, this is C++ assignment.

So what you might want to do is:
	distinct(this, x, ICL_DOM)
	rel(this, x[0], IRT_EQ, 0); // Constrain x[0] to be zero
	status();

which you can also write as:
	distinct(this, x, ICL_DOM);
	post(this, x[0] == 0);
	status();

Cheers
Christian

Hi All,

I have a problem with checking the domain values of variables after posting
constraints. This is an example of the code I have:

  IntVarArray x(this,5,0,4);
  distinct(this, x, ICL_DOM);
  IntVar x1(this,0,0);
  x[0]=x1;
  post(this,x[0]=x1);
  unsigned long int p;
  (void) status(p); // should update the domains?

I would expect x[0] = 0, x[1]=x[2]=x[3]=x[4]= 1...4, but I get x[1]=...=
0...4. So the domains don't seem to be pruned but this should happen,
correct?

Regards,

Dhananjay

Oh, I understand the Queens.java file, but much of the search  
behaviour is hidden inside Options.java, which is harder to follow. I  
was hoping you could explain some of that code as well.

I general, I think that all the examples should use the Options.java
file, since we want all examples to behave the same. Given that, some
explanation in the introduction page could be added to explain what is
done in the Options file. By cutting out all the parts of
Options.doSearch() that are not used for the queens-example, we get
the following code (with some added comments and reformatting):

  // Modified from Options.doSearch()
  public void doSearch(Space g, Stop stop) {
    // Options class for the search-engine
    org.gecode.Options o = new org.gecode.Options();
    o.setA_d(a_d); o.setC_d(c_d); o.setStop(stop);
    // Statistics from the search
    Statistics stat = null;
    // Number of solutions to search for
    long nsols = solutions;
    // Time the search is started
    long startTime = System.nanoTime();
    // Final time
    long time;
    // Construction of search-engine iterator
    DFSIterator<Space> search = new DFSIterator<Space>(g,o);
    // Iterate over all the solutions, until enough has been found
    for (Space sol : search) {
      if (print)
	System.out.println(sol.toString());
      if (--nsols == 0) break;
    }
    // Get and print all relevant statistics
    stat = search.statistics();
    time = System.nanoTime() - startTime;
    System.out.println("Summary:" +
		       "\n\truntime:      " + (time/1000000) +
		       "\n\tsolutions:    " + (solutions-nsols));

Could you please add a toString() method to IntSet in Gecode/J? It  
would help in debugging. At the moment there is no way to inspect the

Subject: [gecode-users] LinExp issue with MSVC 9
Message-ID: <47E19D1F.9080201@logis.cz>

Hi,

when porting my code from Gecode 1.3.1 to 2.1.1 (MSVC 2008 Express 
Edition), the following code

GECODE_ES_CHECK((GqBin<int, IntView, MinusView>::post(home, start[i], 
iv, d)));

("home" is my Space*, "start[i]" is an IntView, "iv" is a MinusView, and 
"d" is an int) worked well with Gecode 1.3.1, but with 2.1.1 I'm getting

C:\lib\gecode-2-vc90\gecode/int/linear.hh(82) : error C4263: 
'Gecode::Reflection::ActorSpec 
Gecode::Int::Linear::LinBin<Val,A,B,pc>::spec(const Gecode::Space 
*,Gecode::Reflection::VarMap &,const Gecode::Support::Symbol &) const' : 
member function does not override any base class virtual member function
        with
        [
            Val=int,
            A=Gecode::Int::IntView,
            B=Gecode::Int::MinusView,
            pc=1
        ]
        C:\lib\gecode-2-vc90\gecode/int/linear.hh(307) : see reference 
to class template instantiation 
'Gecode::Int::Linear::LinBin<Val,A,B,pc>' being compiled
        with
        [
            Val=int,
            A=Gecode::Int::IntView,
            B=Gecode::Int::MinusView,
            pc=1
        ]

It seems that spec() has more arguments in LinBin than in Actor, so the 
compiler chokes. (Note that the function is not explicitly "virtual" in 
LinBin.) This is a "Level 4" warning 4263, which I used to have turned 
into error using, so I wonder whether this should be fixed in Gecode or 
not. The warning says that LinBin::spec() effectively hides 
Actor::spec() in LinBin (which might be intentional, of course, but the 
compiler probably doubts that).

Thanks,
Filip

C4263 is one of the warnings that is off by default, that's why we  
hadn't noticed yet.  I'm not sure what we're going to do about it, the  
code is perfectly legal C++, and it doesn't cause any problems.  I  
wouldn't want to rename the function just because of this warning.   
Does it help to make LinBin::spec virtual itself?  If so, that would  
be an option.

Cheers,

I doubt that. LinBin::spec() has different arguments and so does not 
override Actor::spec(), but it does hide it. The warning says that the 
design is dangerous, because when you have an instance of LinBin, it 
makes a difference whether you call spec() via LinBin or its base class. 
The question is whether you can make Actor::spec() non-virtual, which 
would IMO solve this. The rationale behind the warning is that since you 
have a 'virtual spec()' in base class, having 'spec()' (virtual or not) 
in a derived class suggests that you wish to override the base class's 
version and allow access to it via the virtual function call mechanism. 
I do agree though that this is quite pedantic...

Cheers,
Filip

Reified propagators are nothing special, they just have a Boolean  
variable as an extra argument.  We don't have tutorial documentation  
for propagators.  The best idea would be to start with a simple  
propagator from our library, like equality.  The classes EqBnd (for  
bounds propagation) and EqDom (for domain propagation) are defined in  
gecode/rel.hh, and you find the implementations in geocde/rel/eq.icc.   
You also find reified versions there (ReEqBnd and ReEqDom).

Cheers,

I would like to know if it is possible to determine the last propator
invoked in case Space::status returns ES_FAILED or if there are any
plans to expose this information. If one can get this information (in
the future) will one also introduce reflection API on the Propagator
level?

Hi,

There is no way currently to access this information, and no current
plans to introduce it. However, it would not be hard to implement
yourself. As a starting-point, see the implementation of the function
Space::status in gecode/kernel/core.cc.

What is it that you want to do with this information? Since
propagators do not have any identifier that is stable between copies,
the information seems to me to be of little use.

Cheers,
Mikael

Actually, I have to say that this is not that easy: failure might actually
not be due to the propagator run last. It could be due to a variable
modified outside a propagator (when posting constraint or using a
branching).

Moreover, the propagator run last is typically not the culprit of things
going wrong.

Well, as said the last propagator will just almost never be the reason for
failure: the real reason might be some propagator that ran one million steps
earlier ;-(

I am guessing here but I think that George was referring to step() rather
than propagate() which does a single propagator step at a time and that he
traces all propagator executions for learning nogoods. step() has never made
it into a released system.

But one could enumerate the reasons. I mean being in a search one
could conclude that the reason of a failure is due to the branching in
case one has no propagator and because of the propagator if one has
one. Being outside the search one can conclude the same but the reason
is not the branching but the posting of the constraint in case of a
failure without a last propagator.

Hello,

I also needed that information to implement clause learning. All I did
was modify Space::propagate() to keep track of the propagator that
failed. I admit it may not cover all cases (for example it does cover
failure when the propagator was called from Space::step()), but during
search this seems to be the only path that leads to failure.

Message-ID: <000001c890ac$2cc82cf0$865886d0$@se>

My intuition is as follows:

Scenario a) You want to debug a faulty model (that is, it does not have the
right solutions). You suspect that there is a propagator that is "wrong"
with respect to the problem statement. You would like to find "wrong". But,
"wrong" might never fail (typically, it will not)! It might make some
variable domains shrink but in the end some other propagators use that
information to infer failure.

Scenario b) Your model is correct but you would like to know what is the
reason why a particular choice during branching went wrong. After the choice
made, many propagators will run: the explanation why the choice is wrong is
the execution of all these propagators but not just the last one.

Yes, you are correct as soon as a propagator fails propagation stops
immediately.

Maybe you have other scenarios of interest, but then, as said by George, it
is easy enough to try changing Gecode.

All the best
Christian

Just for my understanding when you say 'the reason of failure' are you
refering to the propagator (assuming it is a propagator) that would
have made at least one domain empty. Also in my understanding I would
expect no more propagators to be invoked after such a propagator has
been invoked. How do you define the 'real reason of failure' and how
is it possible that many more propagators will be invoked after this
propagator?

You have to add the directory that contains the .so files to the  
LD_LIBRARY_PATH, or install gecode in a location that is already on  
the LD_LIBRARY_PATH.

Hm, this might also be a path issue.  Make sure that libgecodesearch.a  
is found in one of the directories mentioned in the -L compiler  
switches.

You must set your paths correctly. For linking against shared
libraries, this means setting LD_LIBRARY_PATH.

Just for my understanding when you say 'the reason of failure' are you
refering to the propagator (assuming it is a propagator) that would
have made at least one domain empty. Also in my understanding I would
expect no more propagators to be invoked after such a propagator has
been invoked. How do you define the 'real reason of failure' and how
is it possible that many more propagators will be invoked after this
propagator?

I have a related problem, I`ve installed the last version of gecode in 2
different machines and tried to use it in a project that I`ve been
developing on gecode 2.0 some months ago. In the first machine it works
fine, in the second one  I get a lot of "undefined references" trying to use
element, and post.  It happens either installing it in /usr/ or just using
the compiled libs, either with gcc 4.1 or gcc 4.3, either with gist or
without gist. (your examples works fine, but I never tried to compile them
by myself ).

could it be a problem of my O.S?

Cheers.

Message-ID: <34d172b40803280915l353f21e0qa37656bb02a7b53e@mail.gmail.com>

Hello

I need to use the offset argument in the element propagator.
But now that no longer exists,I ve been thinking about some ways to achieve
the same effect.

1)
VarArray array;
IntVar var1;
IntVar var2= var1+offset; (using the right propagator of course)
Int value;
element(array, var2, value)

2)
int offset;
VarArray a1(the real thing);
VarArray a2;
element (a2, var1, value);
a1[i+offset]=a2[i]; (using the propagator too )

 I cant get  what is the idea of the dummy objects to the array that you
mention in the changelog, Im very curious about that. Would you explain me
your idea?.
thanks

cheers.

Hello,

Is there something in Gecode like
the "parallel conditional combinator" ?

The dummy objects are the additional dummy variables that you add at  
the beginning of a2.  Your solution 2) (the one with the dummy  
variables) has one clear advantage: you create only one propagator  
instead of two.  That means less memory, and less propagator  
invocations, so it should be more efficient.  The additional variables  
are just present in the root space, they don't even get copied because  
the propagators detects that they're not needed.

One hint: don't create a2 as a VarArray, but as a VarArgArray.  Then  
create one single IntVar dummy, and initialize all elements from  
0..offset-1 with dummy, and the rest with a2[i].  Don't use a  
propagator for equality, but just assign them.  Here's some completely  
untested code:

IntVarArgs a2(a1.size()+offset);
IntVar dummy(this,0,0);
for (int i=0; i<offset; i++) a2[i] = dummy;
for (int i=0; i<a1.size(); i++) a2[i+offset] = a1[i];
element(a2,var1,value);

Cheers,
	Guido

Nope, definitely not. Do not confuse Gecode with Oz just because both have
"spaces". Spaces in Gecode are designed to be good at search and terrible at
magic ;-) While more limited they are really efficient.

My searches in Gecode/J are crashing when with messages like:

java(221,0xb0801000) malloc: *** mmap(size=65536) failed (error code=12)
*** error: can't allocate region
*** set a breakpoint in malloc_error_break to debug
terminate called after throwing an instance of 'Gecode::MemoryExhausted'
   what():  Memory: Heap memory exhausted

Is there any way to avoid these, or at least to make the search fail  
more gracefully?

In general, the memory use in my search problem seems to be quite a  
lot larger than I expected. I have a system with about 250 IntVars. I  
did a search and found a solution with the following statistics:

Clones: 23
Commits: 178
Fails: 0
Propagates: 276937
Memory: 62.4 Mb (65477136 bytes)

That seems like an awfully large amount of memory for a relatively  
small problem. How do I work out what is causing this? In general,  
what are the factors that contribute towards memory usage and how do I  
control them?

What contributes to memory consumption are:
    - How many variables and how big their domain (where size is roughly
      the number of disjoint non-overlapping intervals it is composed of
      for both integer and set variables). For variables it matters
      whether they are referenced from the space itself (that is, the
      variables that constitute the solution). Better keep it small:
      if a variable is not any longer referenced it will go away.
    - How many propagators and how many variables it each propagator
      has. Then also: do you have propagators written in Java or just
      in C++ (Java propagators take much much more memory). The
      capability to add propagators in Java to Gecode/J is just for
      educational purposes.
    - How deep is the search tree.
    - Which recomputation distance are you using. In particular in
      your case, not having any failures, you should increase the
      recomputation distance for search.

As you don't say how many propagators you use we can't really say whether it
is an awful lot of memory or not.

Hope that helps
Christian
