      Sydney,  Australia                     14-18 September 2008

                 <A HREF="http://www.csse.unimelb.edu.au/cp2008/">http://www.csse.unimelb.edu.au/cp2008/</A>

____ Call for Workshops ____

   The CP 2008 Program Committee invites proposals for the Workshop
   Program.

   CP 2008 workshops will provide an informal setting where workshop
   participants will have the opportunity to discuss specific
   technical topics in an atmosphere that facilitates the active
   exchange of ideas.  It is an opportunity to disseminate work in
   progress or to promote new and emerging areas within the field of
   constraints. The topics of the workshops can cover any area related
   to constraints and any related cross-disciplinary areas.  Workshops
   related to planning and scheduling are especially encouraged
   because of the co-location with ICAPS 2008.

   All workshops will take place during 14-15 September 2008 as
   pre-conference activities along tutorials and the doctoral program.

   Workshops can be half-day or full-day.  The internal format of the
   workshop will be determined by the organisers.
