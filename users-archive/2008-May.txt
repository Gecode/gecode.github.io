[Apologies for multiple receipts]

QiCP'2008, Second International Workshop on Quantification in Constraint 
Programming <http://www.univ-orleans.fr/lifo/evenements/QiCP2008/>


----------------------------------

*QiCP'08:*
Second International Workshop on Quantification in Constraint Programming

"Beyond Existentially Quantified Variables"


held in conjunction with CP'2008, 14th International Conference on 
Principles and Practice of Constraint Programming

Sydney, Australia, Sept 14, 2008.

http://www.univ-orleans.fr/lifo/evenements/QiCP2008/

*Overview:*
Constraint Programming is a very successful paradigm to express 
combinatoral
problems for which it provides both a representation language and powerful
solving techniques.  Modeling uncertainty in data and/or the presence of an
adversary can be done by introducing universally quantified and/or 
stochastic
variables.  They are used to encode possible alternative that have to be 
all
taken into account to provide a robust solution.  Possible applications are
games, robust scheduling, conformant planning or model checking for the 
discrete
case.  For continuous variables, it includes control design, 
verification of
safety and performance conditions of a system in engineering or 
determination of
values of design variables compatible with all values of some uncertain 
physical
data.

The first workshop on Quantification in Constraint Programming has been 
held in
conjuction with CP'2005 in Sitges, Spain.  Since then, there has been an
increasing attention to this topic in the areas of QBF, QCSP and continuous
constraints.  The aim of this workshop is to collect papers describing 
novel and
ongoing works in the field, and to foster discussions and 
cross-fertilization
between different approaches.


*Scope:*
This workshop is open to all aspects related to quantification in 
Constraint
Programming and SAT.  The aim of the workshop is to present ongoing work 
and to
exchange ideas on modeling and solving quantified problems. Topics that 
may be
addressed in papers for consideration for inclusion in this workshop 
include,
but are not limited to:
- Search and propagation algorithm
- Modeling issues with quantified languages
- Complexity results
- Quantified global constraints
- Quantified languages design and compilation
- Strategy extraction and representation
- Over-constrained quantified problems, explanations
- First-order constraints
- Quantification in CHR
- Uncertainty handling
- Stochastic constraint programming
- Implementation issues
- Other types of variables, non-backtrackable variables where domain 
prunings are not undone
  on backtracking
- Applications and benchmarks of Quantified Constraints, QBF and 
Stochastic CSP


*Submissions:*
The workshop is open to all members of the CP community.  Submitted 
papers can
be up to 15 pages in length, describing work on one or more of the topics
relevant to the workshop. Alternatively, a shorter paper (maximum 5 
pages) can
be submitted, presenting a research statement or perspective on topics 
relevant
to the workshop.  All submissions will be reviewed and accepted papers 
will be
published in the workshop proceedings. At least one author must attend the
workshop.  The proceedings will be available electronically on the 
workshop web
page and in hardcopy at CP 2008.

We encourage authors to submit papers electronically in pdf format.  Papers
should be formatted using the Lecture Notes in Computer Science (LNCS) 
style. 
All submissions should include the author's name(s), affiliation, complete
mailing address, and email address.  Workshop papers will be published in
workshop notes as well as on the Web.

Subject: [gecode-users] About the parallel conditional combinator in Gecol
Message-ID: <a6b4b44a0805050933k1ebc0587of0bb21172dff1294@mail.gmail.com>

Hello all,How are you doing?

I know that Gecode is not made for concurrent constraint programming
and there are not combinators in Gecode. But, since the ask
propagator worked very good. Now I am interested in writting
the parallel conditional combinator in Gecode. Not necessary
as a combinator, but I need something with this semantic:

Non deterministically choose
  if Boolean var 1 then Process 1
  if Boolean var 2 then Process 2
  if Boolean var n then Process n
end


>From the n variables, I want to execute choose one process
between the variables which value is assigned true.

Since, it is not possible to write non-monotonic propagators in
Gecode, what can I do?

I tried doing the choice, after I reach a fix-point, but what happens
if I have many of this non-deterministic choices?

It is required to write it this using Gecode and being efficient.

All ideas are welcomed. Thanks

P.S : Gecode developers, do you want to include the ask propagator inside
Gecode?
I have an stress example showing better performance than using Mozart-Oz.

Message-ID: <823281170805060028udc45aaam6bac5dde6925cf97@mail.gmail.com>

I am writing a propagator and I want to create a disjunction in the
propagate method. Specifically I have a boolean A and B and want to
post the following:

A = 0 \/ B = 0

I know we have the binary boolean disjunction propagator for true (A=1
\/ B=1), now I am lost how to post the propagator for binary boolean
disjunction false given A and B?

Can I do the following in the propagate method:

Bool::BinOrTrue<BoolView,BoolView>::post(home,!A,!B)

which requires the minimodel which I think is more than I should need.

Hi David,

I guess with "Boolean" you mean BoolView. For Boolean variables another view
exists: NegBoolView which implements Boolean negation (without any cost). So
what you could do is the following:

NegBoolView na(A), nb(B);
Bool::BinOrTrue<NegBoolView,NegBoolView>::post(home,na,nb);


Cheers

Like to give you a heads up on a mistake in the documentation (I
hope). The documentation of Propagator::advise says the following:

....

A propagator must specialize this advise function, if it uses
advisors. The advise function must return an execution status as
follows:

ES_FAILED: the advisor has detected failure
ES_NOFIX: the advisor's propagator (that is, this propagator) does not
need to be run
ES_FIX: the advisor's propagator (that is, this propagator) must be run

....

I think the ES_NOFIX and ES_FIX are mixed up, it should be

ES_NOFIX: the advisor's propagator (that is, this propagator) must be run
ES_FIX: the advisor's propagator (that is, this propagator) does not
need to be run

Can you confirm this?

Hi,

 

There is in principle no problem with a non-deterministic construct in
Gecode: the point is that the full reduction of the construct must be
monotonic. This is no different for parallel conditionals in Mozart, say.

 

I don't feel right now that an ask combinator is of sufficient general
interest to be included in Gecode. We are quite conservative to include new
stuff into Gecode (basically, there should be an application that needs it).
If others think otherwise, please make yourself heard.

 

Cheers

Christian

Hmmm, as you used the word already... "Absurd" is not that far away, maybe
let's call it "daring": each element propagator destructively updates its
IdxView data structure, so they just can't be shared. 

Actually, the same is true for element with integers: the data structure on
which propagation is performed cannot be shared, however the array of
integers from which the datastructure is created can be shared.

In principle it would be possible to design a propagator that shares the
array but it would not buy you much in memory reduction. 

Cheers
Christian

Do you mean Mac OS?  Did you use the dmg package we provide?  It  
installs a Mac OS Framework (read about it in the Apple developer  
documentation), and all the libraries are linked together into one  
library, called gecode.  In order to compile and link against the  
framework, you just have to give the option "-framework gecode" when  
linking, the header files are found automatically.

Cheers,
	Guido

Hello for all,

I need make this flow constraint for a routing problem:
(in latex): \sum_j x_{ ij } = \sum_j x_{ ji }
(in ampl): sum {j in J} x[i,j] - sum {j in J} x[j,i] = 0

(where x[i,j] is a binary variable,  for all i in I and j in J.). I
tried to do this constraint in gecodej (in java), but is incorrect:

[...]

Error: "operator: cannot be applied to VarArray<IntVar>, VarArray<IntVar>"

How I can implement this constraint in gecode/gecodej? There are
gecode examples for vehicle routing problem?


Thank you.

I'd like to express the constraint:

A = (B - C) mod n
0 <= A < n

for variables A,B,C and constant n.

How would you advise doing this? The obvious answer is to add an extra  
variable X:

A = (B-C) + n * X
0 <= A < n

but I'm not sure if this is best. Can you advise?

You cannot use expressions like x-y for posting constraints (not in  
Java, anyway).  You have to use an integer array with coefficients  
{1,-1} and an array of IntVar containing x.row[i] and x.col[i] instead  
and give those to linear.  See the documentation of the linear  
constraint posting function.

Moreover, if the variables are 0/1 it is better to use BoolVar instead of
IntVar.

As there's no built-in propagator for the modulo constraint, you have  
to decompose into other constraints, so your solution should be ok.   
After all, it's just a linear equation with constant coefficients  
1*A-1*B+1*C-n*X=0, right?  And X will be determined as soon as A,B,C  
are, you don't even have to include X in the branching.

Well, I cannot reproduce what you say. I get the latter solution using
Gecode 2.1.1!

Which version of Gecode, btw.

Message-ID: <a6b4b44a0805210138t3eae23d3o4df92dacc863754f@mail.gmail.com>

Hello all,I want to propagate a constraint between variables in different
spaces.
How can this be done?

For example

mySpace * a = new mySpace();
mySpace * b = new mySpace();
IntVar aa(a,1,10);
IntVar bb(b,1,10);
rel(a,aa,IRT_EQ,2);
a->status();
rel(b,bb,IRT_EQ,aa);
b->status();
std::cout << aa << " " << bb; // should print : 2 2

It does not work this way. Is there a way to do it?
Maybe cloning the variable or something?

Thanks

You can't. The best you might is a segfault. There is currently no way to do
it. One could build a special propagator that channels across spaces but
that would be pretty tricky: who will take care of that propagator during
copying, for example.

 

My question is: why would you like to do that?

Well that would not be channeling, it would just transfer the current domain
from one space to another. As said, it can be done but it is non-trivial: it
would require locking as different spaces can be run by different threads.

 

What I meant by copying is: suppose that you have a propagator between
spaces s1 and s2. Now you clone s1. What should happen to the propagator?
Should it be cloned as well?

 

If you do not use cloning you could build a propagator, it would basically
be two propagators, one in each space.

 

I am not yet convinced that Gecode is a good platform for CCP, it is really
designed for constraint reasoning.

If I am not using search/branching should I worry about cloning spaces?Does
the spaces clone in other cases different than when I do braching?

Thanks

No, cloning is never done implicitly.

Well that would not be channeling, it would just transfer the current domain
from one space to another. As said, it can be done but it is non-trivial: it
would require locking as different spaces can be run by different threads.

 

What I meant by copying is: suppose that you have a propagator between
spaces s1 and s2. Now you clone s1. What should happen to the propagator?
Should it be cloned as well?

 

If you do not use cloning you could build a propagator, it would basically
be two propagators, one in each space.

 

I am not yet convinced that Gecode is a good platform for CCP, it is really
designed for constraint reasoning.

Hello all,

 

Is it possible to do the channeling for IntVar using a IntSet?

like dom(space1,var1,intset); dom(space2,var2,intset); ?

 

Why do you mean by copying it?

 

I have made an interpreter for CCP calculus using gecode.

Now I am trying to extend the interpreter for Time Concurrent Constraint
Calculus.

which is an extension where we have multiple spaces.

each one representing a time unit. The problem is when we want to represent 

persistent assignation, something like "forever tell(x =
Variable_In_Time_Unit_1)".

 

Notice that for all this models we do not use search, we are only interested
in propagation.

 

Any ideas?

 

Thanks

 

2008/5/21 Christian Schulte <cschulte at kth.se>:

 

You can't. The best you might is a segfault. There is currently no way to do
it. One could build a special propagator that channels across spaces but
that would be pretty tricky: who will take care of that propagator during
copying, for example.

 

My question is: why would you like to do that?

 

Cheers

Christian

Hello all,

I want to propagate a constraint between variables in different spaces.

How can this be done?

 

For example

 

mySpace * a = new mySpace();

mySpace * b = new mySpace();

IntVar aa(a,1,10);

IntVar bb(b,1,10);

rel(a,aa,IRT_EQ,2);

a->status();

rel(b,bb,IRT_EQ,aa);

b->status();

std::cout << aa << " " << bb; // should print : 2 2

 

It does not work this way. Is there a way to do it?

Maybe cloning the variable or something?

 

Thanks

Hello all,
How can I write a multiplication constraint like this:
IntVar a,b,c;
a = b+c; // constraint

I tried using Gecode::Int::Arithmetic::MultPlus
but I do not know how to call it.

Thanks,

That's a feature and not a bug. The result of propagation is deterministic,
the order of how propagators are executed is not. Different order can the
result in a different number of propagations.

 

The order can differ because some propagators normalize their variables (for
example, linear, distinct, etc). Typically, normalization involves ordering
variables according to their addresses in memory (which is platform
dependent). Performing operations on differently ordered variables then will
also schedule propagators in different orders.

 

Hope that helps

Christian

2.4Ghz under  ubuntu 7.01  (i386),  gcc version 4.0.1 and a Intel Xeon  2.33
Ghz under Mandriva 2008 (x86_64), gcc version 4.2.3. Of course I'm running
the same gecode version in both machines (gecode-2-1-1) 

Despite of I'm getting the same search tree, the number of propagations is
different for some instances of some problems, for instance:

Can someone explain me this behavior.

Hello all,

 

I am running this program:

     IntVar a(this,1,10);

     IntVar b(this,2,20);

     IntVar c(this,0,30);

     mult(this,a,b,c);

     rel(this,a,IRT_EQ,5);

     rel(this,b,IRT_EQ,5);

     std::cout << "c " << c << "a " << a << " b " << b;

 

And I am getting this result: a= 5 b= 5 c = [1..30]

 

I was wondering why I do not get c = 25?

Is there a way to make to rewrite my program

to get that result?

 

Thanks

In general, no: the address will definitely change when you clone a space.

 

Moreover, we will not make the guarantee of pointer-safeness (some other
operations might change addresses too).

IntVar * get_IntVar(Space * h,IntVar * pos, IntVarArray & array)
{
     IntVar * answer = new IntVar(h,1,1000);
     element(h, array, *pos, *answer);

}

IntVar & get_IntVar(Space * h,IntVar & pos, IntVarArray & array)
{
     IntVar answer(h,1,1000);
     element(h, array, pos, answer);
     return answer;
}

Are both "pointer safe"?
I mean, is it necesary to allocate memory

it allocates its own memory?

You can of course pass IntVars by reference, but it is not needed.

 

Do not use new! None of the modeling abstractions in Gecode needs that. The
only thing you will do is to create a memory leak (maybe we should have 

made new and delete for all variables and arrays private).

And what about IntVars? can I use references two?

for example:

 

IntVar * get_IntVar(Space * h,IntVar * pos, IntVarArray & array)

{

     IntVar * answer = new IntVar(h,1,1000);

     element(h, array, *pos, *answer); 

     return answer;

}

 

IntVar & get_IntVar(Space * h,IntVar & pos, IntVarArray & array)

{

     IntVar answer(h,1,1000);

     element(h, array, pos, answer); 

     return answer;

}

 

Are both "pointer safe"?

I mean, is it necesary to allocate memory 

for IntVars using new, or when I create the IntVar object

it allocates its own memory?

Subject: [gecode-users] pointer safe (sorry for multiple posting)

 

Hello all,

 

I would like to know if this functions are "pointer safe",

I was looking at the array implementation and I think

it manage its own memory allocation.

 

IntVarArray create(Space * h, int size)

{

   return IntVarArray(h,size,1,1000);

}

 

IntVar * get_IntVar(Space * h,IntVar * pos, IntVarArray array)

{

     IntVar * answer = new IntVar(h,1,1000);

     element(h, array, *pos, *answer); 

     return answer;

}

 

IntVar * get_IntVar(Space * h,int pos, IntVarArray array)

{

     return &array[pos];

}

 

I tried using new with IntVarArray but it not allowed.

Is there a problem of creating an IntVarArray in a function and returning
it?

is there a problem with the other two?

 

Thanks
