QiCP'2008, Second International Workshop on Quantification in Constraint 
Programming &lt;<A HREF="http://www.univ-orleans.fr/lifo/evenements/QiCP2008/">http://www.univ-orleans.fr/lifo/evenements/QiCP2008/</A>&gt;


----------------------------------

*QiCP'08:*
Second International Workshop on Quantification in Constraint Programming

&quot;Beyond Existentially Quantified Variables&quot;


held in conjunction with CP'2008, 14th International Conference on 
Principles and Practice of Constraint Programming

Sydney, Australia, Sept 14, 2008.

<A HREF="http://www.univ-orleans.fr/lifo/evenements/QiCP2008/">http://www.univ-orleans.fr/lifo/evenements/QiCP2008/</A>

*Overview:*
Constraint Programming is a very successful paradigm to express 
combinatoral
problems for which it provides both a representation language and powerful
solving techniques.  Modeling uncertainty in data and/or the presence of an
adversary can be done by introducing universally quantified and/or 
stochastic
variables.  They are used to encode possible alternative that have to be 
all
taken into account to provide a robust solution.  Possible applications are
games, robust scheduling, conformant planning or model checking for the 
discrete
case.  For continuous variables, it includes control design, 
verification of
safety and performance conditions of a system in engineering or 
determination of
values of design variables compatible with all values of some uncertain 
physical
data.

The first workshop on Quantification in Constraint Programming has been 
held in
conjuction with CP'2005 in Sitges, Spain.  Since then, there has been an
increasing attention to this topic in the areas of QBF, QCSP and continuous
constraints.  The aim of this workshop is to collect papers describing 
novel and
ongoing works in the field, and to foster discussions and 
cross-fertilization
between different approaches.


*Scope:*
This workshop is open to all aspects related to quantification in 
Constraint
Programming and SAT.  The aim of the workshop is to present ongoing work 
and to
exchange ideas on modeling and solving quantified problems. Topics that 
may be
addressed in papers for consideration for inclusion in this workshop 
include,
but are not limited to:
- Search and propagation algorithm
- Modeling issues with quantified languages
- Complexity results
- Quantified global constraints
- Quantified languages design and compilation
- Strategy extraction and representation
- Over-constrained quantified problems, explanations
- First-order constraints
- Quantification in CHR
- Uncertainty handling
- Stochastic constraint programming
- Implementation issues
- Other types of variables, non-backtrackable variables where domain 
prunings are not undone
  on backtracking
- Applications and benchmarks of Quantified Constraints, QBF and 
Stochastic CSP


*Submissions:*
The workshop is open to all members of the CP community.  Submitted 
papers can
be up to 15 pages in length, describing work on one or more of the topics
relevant to the workshop. Alternatively, a shorter paper (maximum 5 
pages) can
be submitted, presenting a research statement or perspective on topics 
relevant
to the workshop.  All submissions will be reviewed and accepted papers 
will be
published in the workshop proceedings. At least one author must attend the
workshop.  The proceedings will be available electronically on the 
workshop web
page and in hardcopy at CP 2008.

We encourage authors to submit papers electronically in pdf format.  Papers
should be formatted using the Lecture Notes in Computer Science (LNCS) 
style. 
All submissions should include the author's name(s), affiliation, complete
mailing address, and email address.  Workshop papers will be published in
workshop notes as well as on the Web.

Please send your submission by email
