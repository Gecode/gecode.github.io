ES_OK is used when we just want to distinguish between FAILED and not  
FAILED, for example in branchings.  You can ignore it for propagators.

</I>&gt;<i> seems like i return fail but the space somehow doesn't fail at all.
</I>
I'm not sure that is what happens.  I rather suspect a problem with  
recomputation: when recomputing a node, Gist expects that node not to  
be failed, because it wasn't failed when it was visited previously.   
If you have nonmonotonic propagators, or wrongly report FIX when you  
are not at a fixed point, this invariant does not hold any longer.
The non-gui search engines have been adapted to be able to cope with  
non-monotonic propagators, Gist apparently isn't fully compatible  
yet.  If your propagator is nonmonotonic, you should think about  
whether this is by design or by accident - in most cases, nonmonotonic  
propagation is a bug.

Cheers,
	Guido
