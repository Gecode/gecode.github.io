<PRE>Hello,
I am writing because I have been noticing a memory issue on Gecode/J. I 
wanted to see if anyone has experienced something similar to what I am 
seeing.

I have an application which generates Gecode/J CLPs, compiles, loads, 
and runs the solver on them. I am noticing that after I generate several 
problems, my memory usage (looking at 'top') keeps increasing. I am 
looking at the garbage collector output, using the -verbose:gc flag when 
invoking the jvm, and it is reporting much lower memory usage than what 
I see through top. I've also looked at profiler dumps using hprof, and 
all the Java objects seem to be getting collected properly. I am assumed 
this was an issue with the interface from Java to C, so i tried making 
explicit calls to Space.delete() with no improvement. In an old post 
(<A HREF="http://www.mozart-oz.org/pipermail/gecode-users/2006-March/001013.html">http://www.mozart-oz.org/pipermail/gecode-users/2006-March/001013.html</A>), 
I read there had been an issue with the Java wrapper, which leads me to 
think, maybe there is something still amiss(?).

Does anyone have any knowledge of what may be causing this?
I am using Gecode/J 2.2.0 under Sun JVM 1.6.0_06-b02, in a 2.6.24 Linux 
kernel.
I also compiled the Gecode libraries with gcc 4.2.3
