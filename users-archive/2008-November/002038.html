<PRE>Dears,

  I am writing a bachelor thesis which is focused on comparing of
several constraint solvers. I compare the objective criterions - the
spent time and memory on solving of several benchmarks as well as
subjective criterions - the main focus is on easiness of learning of
usage.

Now I am in state, that Gecode looks interesting, it seems it offers
lots of possibilites how to describe a constraint problem but there is
a bit lack of documentation. I found only a doxygen generated
documentation but this is by my opinion best for &quot;user who knows what
and how but doesnt know the exact spelling of function names or their
parameters&quot; but mostly unuseful for new users who would need some
introduction. There are also some example problems, but the fact that
it is implementation of Example&lt;&gt; template, and the actual calls to
solver (initialization, etc.) is hidden somewhere in the parent
classes makes it more difficult for a newbie.

So my question is simple: Is there some tutorial to Gecode, even if
that would be for example only draft or something like that?

Thanks for answer, Michal Tulacek
