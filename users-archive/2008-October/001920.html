<PRE>Just as a quick follow-up, Choco used to have a feature called  
explanations, which would probably do what you're looking for, but as  
far as I understand, they have been removed from the current release.

Cheers,
	Guido

</I>&gt;<i> system could use the reasons of the CSP solver to produce better

</I>&gt;<i> have
</I>&gt;<i> to use a trivial reason, which means a constraint rule applies because
</I>&gt;<i> of all other constraint rules the same variable occurs in. But this
</I>&gt;<i> reason is not very specific and is not very applicable for  
</I>&gt;<i> backjumping.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Maybe someone of the SMT (Sat Modulo Theory) area reads this message  
</I>&gt;<i> and
</I>&gt;<i> can provide information on how this is done in SMT Solvers, as they
</I>&gt;<i> incorporate CSP into SAT and using learning techniques. But all  
</I>&gt;<i> systems
</I>&gt;<i> i found up to now seam to have written their own theory(CSP) solver.
</I>&gt;<i> So if someone knows a CSP library capable of producing non trivial
</I>&gt;<i> reasons and maybe doing conflict analysis, it would be great to post
</I>&gt;<i> them here. Or maybe someone has an understaning how the SMT people do
</I>&gt;<i> the things they do.

</I>&gt;&gt;<i> you probably already know me from the GeCode mailing list.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> I just have a silly? question that i do not wanted to post on the  
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> list.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> It regards learning in gecode.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> I'm not very familiar with constraint programming but it seems to me
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> that things like backjumping and conflict learning already made it
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> into the current CSP systems.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Found a paper: Backjump-based backtracking for constraint  
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> satisfaction
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> problems by Rina Dechter and Daniel Frost
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> So, does GeCode really not support learning and backjumping? Because
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> these features seem to be necessary for my diploma thesis and gecode
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> seems to be a state of the art CSP solver and one of the best  
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> looking.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> So my first question would be: Why it is not supported? - and my
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> second barefaced question- : Do you know a similar CSP lib where it  
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> is
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> supported?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> It is not supported (and won't be in the near future), because no one
</I>&gt;<i> knows how to do it properly.  The work by Dechter et al uses a naive
</I>&gt;<i> model, where CSPs are represented entirely by binary constraints which
</I>&gt;<i> are given as lists of allowed pairs of values.  In this setup,  
</I>&gt;<i> learning
</I>&gt;<i> is relatively straightforward.  In a realistic, propagation-based
</I>&gt;<i> constraint solver, it is not.
</I>&gt;<i> That also answers your second question: I don't know of any realistic
</I>&gt;<i> library that does learning.  None of the commercial packages (ILOG
</I>&gt;<i> Solver, SICStus Prolog, B-Prolog) incorporates learning, nor does  
</I>&gt;<i> any of
</I>&gt;<i> the other free libraries like Choco or Minion.  The closest you can  
</I>&gt;<i> get
</I>&gt;<i> is the work on &quot;Propagation = Lazy Clause Generation&quot;
</I>&gt;<i> (<A HREF="http://www.cs.bgu.ac.il/~mcodish/Papers/Pages/cp07.html">http://www.cs.bgu.ac.il/~mcodish/Papers/Pages/cp07.html</A>), this is the
</I>&gt;<i> most promising attempt at using SAT learning technology for CP  
</I>&gt;<i> solving I
</I>&gt;<i> know of (but it's quite different from classic CP solvers).
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Btw, you can ask questions like this on the mailing list, no problem.
</I>&gt;<i> It's about why we do/don't do certain things, so it definitely fits!
</I>&gt;<i> Maybe you can elaborate how learning is important for what you want  
</I>&gt;<i> to do.
</I>&gt;<i>
