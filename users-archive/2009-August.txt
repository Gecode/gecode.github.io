hi everybody,

I don't understant the concept of views and propagators implementation, can you give me other details and examples about views and 
the necessary steps to implement a propagator, because i took a look on some constraint such as distinct, but i it's very vagness for me.

thanks,
amina.

Hi,

there are two papers about views, linked from the publication section  
on our web page ("Views and iterators..." and "Perfect derived  
propagators"), and a more detailed explanation in my thesis which is  
also available there.  And you should first look at simpler  
propagators than distinct, e.g. EqBnd.

Message-ID: <33039a7c0908020611q16948e29y8249797a36fa1f8@mail.gmail.com>

hi,

There have two questions which have puzzled me for a short long time. They
are as follows:

1. the difference bettween IntVarArray and IntVarArgs ?and how to use them
   As explained in the manual of Gecode,  IntVarArgs is Argument array
which is just good enough for passing arguments with automatic memory
management. IntVarArray is Variable array which can store variables and be
used for storing the variables being part of a solution (script).
 From these description,i can see that IntVarArgs can be used when i need
automatic memory management.But When i need automatic memory management, i
don't know. If you give me an simple example, i maybe can understand it.

2. how to post the constraint ----multiplication of two variable?
   For instance ,
             IntVarArry  x;
              x(*this,4,1,6);
          I want to have a constraint " x[0] * x[1] = x[2] ".when i write "
post(*this, x[0] * x[1]   ==  x[2],o pt.icl( ) );" in my test program,
errors come out.  I began to doubt that whether you can use the sign of " *
".  After testing " post(*this, 2 * x[1]   ==  x[2],o pt.icl( )  );", i have
know that i can use " * ". So, I doubt that we can't multiply two variable
with the sign " * ". Who can tell me how to add this constraint ?

Thanks your help.

Take sudoku as an example.  It has 81 variables, one for each field,  
so you have an IntVarArray x for these variables.  Now you want to  
post the constraint that the first row, x[0],...,x[8] must be  
distinct.  So you create an IntVarArgs containing those variables and  
pass it to the distinct constraint.  You don't have to worry about  
memory management for that array.

The minimodel library (which contains the post(...) functions) only  
supports linear expressions, i.e. multiplication with constants.  To  
multiply two variables, use the mult constraint.

Cheers,

hi Guido,
Thanks for your reply!
1. The second question is not a problem to me now, for your reminding. Yes.
As you said, if i want to multiply two variables, mult constraint is a
choose.  Because of carelessness, i have to study manual of Gecode well
again.
2. But i still not understand your reply well about the first question.
whether your means are that distinct constraint is only used for IntVarArgs,
as written in the manual of Gecode ---
  " void  Gecode::distinct<mk:@MSITStore:D:\Program%20Files\Gecode\doc\GecodeReference.chm::/group__TaskModelIntDistinct.html#g5f4f4006b72f95618b3030815a8718a5>(Space
&home, const IntVarArgs &
x<mk:@MSITStore:D:\Program%20Files\Gecode\doc\GecodeReference.chm::/kakuro_8cpp.html#e928e6fd222358d27be0a56a8ade81ce>,
IntConLevel icl=ICL_DEF)"
But i found that  i can also use IntVarArray in distinct constraint through
testing, and also see it in the example "money.cpp" supplied by the manual
of Gecode 3.1.0. As follows:
  " IntVarArray le;
   distinct(*this, le, opt.icl()) "
I know they are Array, from their definition i have no idea to understand
the reason why they can all be used in distinct constraint .
Look forward to your reply.
Thanks
Kayler

icl=ICL_DEF)"

But i found that  i can also use IntVarArray in distinct constraint through
testing, and also see it in the example "money.cpp" supplied by the manual
of Gecode 3.1.0. As follows:

  " IntVarArray le;

   distinct(*this, le, opt.icl()) "

I know they are Array, from their definition i have no idea to understand
the reason why they can all be used in distinct constraint .

 

Read 4.2.2 in the tutorial.

Subject: [gecode-users] Segmentation fault in a very simple model
Message-ID: <d33b34f60908040642x175ebc2bs911d3f020cd2bfa@mail.gmail.com>

Hello,

I'm getting started with Gecode reading "Modeling with Gecode". I have
experience in Constraint Programming using iLog software.

I installed Gecode and I created a project to test it. I used SendMoreMoney
example. Everything is ok and I can compile and execute this example.

However, when I tried to build my own simple model, compilation is ok but I
get a segmentation fault when posting a linear constraint. It is very
strange because I imitated SendMoreMoney example. I searched in mailing list
but I didn't find anything.

I show you the code. In main.cpp we have:

int main(int argc, char* argv[]) {
  SchoolTimeTable* problem = new SchoolTimeTable();
[...]
  return 0;
}

In schoolTimeTable.h we have:

#include <gecode/int.hh>

using namespace Gecode;

class SchoolTimeTable : public Space {
protected:
  BoolVarArray m_vars;
public:
  SchoolTimeTable(void);
  SchoolTimeTable(bool share, SchoolTimeTable& s);
  virtual Space* copy(bool share);
  void print(void) const;
};

In schoolTimeTable.cpp we have:

#include "schoolTimeTable.h"
#include <gecode/search.hh>

SchoolTimeTable::SchoolTimeTable(void){
  m_vars = BoolVarArray(*this,900);

  BoolVarArgs borrame(3);
  for (int i=0; i<3; i++) borrame[i]=m_vars[i];
  linear(*this,borrame,IRT_EQ,2); // SIGSEGV IS HERE
}

SchoolTimeTable::SchoolTimeTable(bool share, SchoolTimeTable& s)
  : Space(share, s) {
  m_vars.update(*this, share, s.m_vars);
}

Space* SchoolTimeTable::copy(bool share) {
  return new SchoolTimeTable(share,*this);
}

Technical data:

OS: Debian GNU/Linux Squeeze
Gecode version: 3.1.0
gcc version: 4.3.3
gdb version: 6.8

Thank you very much,

Alfredo

Dear Alfredo,

I think the problem lies in the initialization of the BoolVarArray.   
Even for BoolVars, you have to give an initial domain, so you should  
change the code to
   m_vars = BoolVarArray(*this,900, 0,1);

The way you wrote it, you just allocated an array of size 900 with  
uninitialized variables, that's probably why it crashed.

Hope this helps,
	Guido

hi,

     A question came out when i used Channel constraints. One type of
Channel constrains is for two integer variable arrays x and y of same size,
for example
  "
   channel(home, x, y);
    posts the constraint
                      Xi   = j  <==>  Yj  = i    for 0 ? i, j < |x|
"
 When i made a test , the result was not what it should to be.
 My tools are VS2008,Gecode 3.1.0. My test is

 "
#include <gecode/driver.hh>
#include <gecode/int.hh>
using namespace Gecode;

class Fournum : public Script
{
protected:
  IntVarArray num;
  IntVarArray mun;

public:
 Fournum(const Options& opt) : num(*this,3,0,2),mun(*this,3,0,2)
 {


  channel(*this,num,mun);
  branch(*this, num, INT_VAR_NONE, INT_VAL_MIN);
  branch(*this,mun, INT_VAR_NONE, INT_VAL_MIN);
 }

 virtual void
 print(std::ostream& os) const
 {
    os << "\t" << num<<"-------"<<mun<<std::endl;
 }

  Fournum(bool share, Fournum& s) : Script(share,s)
 {
       num.update(*this, share, s.num);
       mun.update(*this,share,s.num);
    }

  virtual Space*  copy(bool share)
 {
   return new Fournum(share,*this);
 }

};

int main()
{
 Options opt("\tJust for test");
 opt.solutions(0);
 opt.iterations(20000);
 Script::run<Fournum,DFS,Options>(opt);
 system("pause");
 return 0;
}
"
  The result is
       {0, 1, 2}-------{0, 1, 2}
       {0, 2, 1}-------{0, 2, 1}
       {1, 0, 2}-------{1, 0, 2}
       {1, 2, 0}-------{1, 2, 0}
       {2, 0, 1}-------{2, 0, 1}
       {2, 1, 0}-------{2, 1, 0}
You can see that the fourth and the fifth are not right . Who can tell me
why ?

Look forward to your reply!

Your copy constructor is wrong: the second update should update from s.mun
and not from s.num.

OMG, I checked the code for a long time before, but with no result. It was a
logistic error.Thank you for reminding me.

Now the program runs Ok!

Thanks again!

[amina at localhost modeles]$








"send-more-money.cpp" which i used is the same model given in the
documentation "modeling with gecode", i followed all the steps mentionned



in this documentation, can you help me? thanks.

The version of Gecode you use is too old.  You must use the same  
version as "Modeling with Gecode", currently 3.1.0.

"send-more-money.cpp" which i used is the same model given in the

Hi,

thank you for the answer, I changed the version of gecode but now when i execute the commands :

g++ -I<dir>/include -c send-more-money.cpp
g++ -L<dir>/lib send-more-money.o \
-lgecodeint -lgecodesearch -lgecodekernel -lgecodesupport

i don't obtain any error, but no executable file generated, there is only the code object file?

thanks.

The executable is probably called a.out.  You can of course add "-o  
send-more-money" to the second g++ call.  I'll update the tutorial  
accordingly.

Subject: [gecode-users] compiling a new propagator
Message-ID: <SNT117-W10BB4DD483DE943565013DA4020@phx.gbl>


Hi,
I have implemented a constraint named "Aminadistinct(Space& home, const IntVarArgs& x, IntConLevel icl)", I considere just the value consistency,
so, I generate the following files:

gecode/int/Aminadistinct.hh
gecode/int/Aminadistinct.cpp
gecode/int/AminaDistinct/val.hpp

for the compilation, I modified the makefile, by adding these three files to INTSRC0, INTHDR0 and SETBUILDDIRS.

when I compile gecode :
$make
$make install

no error obtained, 

but when I call Aminadistinct(...) through an example; i obtained an error message after the second command:


$g++ -I/usr/local/include/ -c example.cpp
$g++ -L/usr/local/lib/ example.o -lgecodeint -lgecodesearch

example.o: In function `example::example()':
example.cpp:(.text._ZN6exampleC1Ev[example::example()]+0x1e5): undefined reference to `Gecode::Aminadistinct(Gecode::Space&, Gecode::VarArgArray<Gecode::IntVar> const&, Gecode::IntConLevel)'
collect2: ld a retourn? 1 code d'?tat d'ex?cution

the question is how to compile a new propagator?

thanks;
amina.

Are you sure you provide an implementation for:

Gecode::Aminadistinct(Gecode::Space&,  
Gecode::VarArgArray<Gecode::IntVar> const&, Gecode::IntConLevel)


The problem can also be the way you link your executable. I think the  
problem is that you didn't provide an implementation for it or you  
forgot to link the object file of the propagator when linking your  
example.

you can try:

$g++ -I/usr/local/include/ -c Aminadistinct.cpp -o Aminadistinct.o
$g++ -I/usr/local/include/ -c example.cpp
$g++ -L/usr/local/lib/ example Aminadistinct.o -lgecodeint - 
lgecodesearch

Gustavo

hi, 

I still have the same error message when calling the new propagator that I added to the gecode/int package!

if you can give me the steps to compile a new propagator and how to use it under gecode?

thanks,

Can you put your code somewhere where I can take a look at it?, In  
this way I can try to help you. Please, do not attach the files to  
your answer as in some mailing list people do not like that; just give  
me a link to a page where I can found it.

One possible problem could be that you declare a non-template  
propagator.  In that case, you may have to export all functions that  
must be publicly available using the GECODE_INT_EXPORT macro.   
Alternatively, you can try running configure with the --disable-gcc- 
visibility option in order to switch on automatic export of all  
functions.
Another option is to put your propagator not inside Gecode, but into  
your own code (e.g. directly into the example.cpp file).  That's  
better practice anyway, as otherwise you'll end up patching your  
propagator into Gecode with every version we release.

Anyway, you should verify with the nm and c++filt commands whether the  
symbols actually end up in the generated .o and/or .so files.

Cheers,
	Guido

Hi,

thank you very much Mr Guido and Mr Gustavo.
you have reason Mr Gustavo in your first reply, in fact i didn't read the command attentively, I forgot to link 
the object file of  the propagator when linking the example :

$g++ -I/usr/local/include/ -c Aminadistinct.cpp -o Aminadistinct.o
$g++ -I/usr/local/include/ -c example.cpp
$g++ -L/usr/local/lib/ example Aminadistinct.o -lgecodeint -lgecodesearch


thanks, 
amina.

you call new (maybe the type of temp) that is the problem.

hi,
    The type of temp is Int. For the project is so large , i can't copy the
whole codes here.But when  i use another method  like code lines below , it
can run OK!
"               ??
 GenSolModel a(temp);
 GenSolModel *m =&a;

 DFS<GenSolModel> e(m);
 m = NULL;
 while(GenSolModel *s = e.next())
 {
  s->print();
  delete s;
  sum++;
 }
            ??
"
   This way to creat an object of the class GenSolModel is a feasible way.
But why the "New "way can't run OK. I doubt it may be the conflict error
between "C++ new" and "'Gecode::Space::operator new",but  why it can run ok
in other project, Maybe the answer is hidden in my project. It also a puzzle
to me.
    Who have faced the similar question ? Wish to your reply.
    If everyone can give me a suggest , i will appreciate your help.

Kayler

hi,
    There has only that error
"projectdlg.cpp(198) : error C2660: 'Gecode::Space::operator new' : function
does not take 3 arguments"
    the error line is
" GenSolModel * m = new GenSolModel (temp);"
    Yeah,it may be so. i have to use another way ---"GenSolModel a(temp);
GenSolModel *m =&a;" to instead of it. Luckily, it can run OK. For the
reason of time, i will hang it for a while . I will find this
bug and uncover it to the sun in my free time. Thanks for your reply.

Hi, if you can?t give us the code we can?t help.

 

Actually, this is the C++ new operator (just defined for this class). So
there will be a bug somewhere in your program, almost 100% sure.

Hi,

Maybe you could send the COMPLETE error message, and copy EXACTLY the lines
that the which the compiler reports the error.  It may be a compiler bug or
something similar.

Best regards,

2009/8/26 Kayler Yao <risoay at gmail.com>

hi,

    The type of temp is Int. For the project is so large , i can't copy the
whole codes here.But when  i use another method  like code lines below , it
can run OK!

"               



 GenSolModel a(temp);

 GenSolModel *m =&a;

 

 DFS<GenSolModel> e(m);

 m = NULL;

 while(GenSolModel *s = e.next())
 {
  s->print();
  delete s;

  sum++;
 }
            



"

   This way to creat an object of the class GenSolModel is a feasible way.
But why the "New "way can't run OK. I doubt it may be the conflict error
between "C++ new" and "'Gecode::Space::operator new",but  why it can run ok
in other project, Maybe the answer is hidden in my project. It also a puzzle
to me. 

    Who have faced the similar question ? Wish to your reply.

    If everyone can give me a suggest , i will appreciate your help.

Hi, I think I need to see the full code to help. There must be something how
you call new (maybe the type of temp) that is the problem.

hi,

    I had a trouble in my project when i wrote a class  inheriting from
Class Space and run it with DFS. The error is

 

"error C2660: 'Gecode::Space::operator new' : function does not take 3

       I have spent much time to find the reason but with no results. I had
written anther question class to test ,and it could run OK. I think that the
constructor of

this class didn't conflict with the class Space , but why came out this
error. Who can give me a thought to help me to find the answer?

hi,
   Thanks for your reply.

   The project what i participate in is too large to supply the whole
codes. So i can only supply such small part of codes. And also caring about
schedule of the project , i have to hang it. So i am using another way to
realize it and will seek for  time to handle it in the future. (It can be
sure that there have a bug in my part of program, i will tell everyone the
bug  when i find it in the future.)
   Thank everyone who pay attention to my question!

hi?
    I want to create an object of IntArgs in my program dynamically. For
instance " IntArgs *pt = new IntArgs(4); -----create an object of IntArgs
with four elements" or
"IntArgs *pt = new IntArgs [10];------create an array with 10 object of
IntArgs." They all be compiled with errors. And i haven't seen the examples
of create object dynamically in Gecode. And I want to know whether the
Gecode support to create object of Gecode class ? And how ?
Look forward to your reply!

hi,
  And i find that "Gecode::Support::DynamicArray< T, A > Class Template"
maybe can realize it. But i did it  unsuccessfully.
Who can give me right answer.

Subject: [gecode-users] A constrain with 3 IntVar
Message-ID: <SNT117-W52C68305AA2FC01F495EFAA4F40@phx.gbl>


Hi,

I am writing a new constraint "NewConstraint", which takes 3 IntVar as arguments :

#include <algorithm>
#include <gecode/int.hh>

namespace Gecode {

  using namespace Int;

  void NewConstraint(Space& home, IntVar x0, IntVar x1, IntVar x3) {
    
    if (home.failed()) return;

    //  Creation of an array x, which contains the 3 variables x0,x1,x2;
    //  .....

    // ViewArray<IntView> xv(home,x); 
    // GECODE_ES_FAIL(home, NewConstraint::Diff<IntView>::post(home,xv)); 
  }
}

To post the constraint  i need to create a ViewArray, but i don't understand how to create an IntVarArg  containing these variables ?

Thank you.

Sorry, you are totally on the wrong track here, please consult an example
(just search the mailing list for a discussion of this).

 

Constraints are implemented as propagators, and propagators use views not
variables.

Subject: [gecode-users] A constrain with 3 IntVar

 

Hi,

I am writing a new constraint "NewConstraint", which takes 3 IntVar as
arguments :

#include <algorithm>
#include <gecode/int.hh>

namespace Gecode {

  using namespace Int;

  void NewConstraint(Space& home, IntVar x0, IntVar x1, IntVar x3) {
    
    if (home.failed()) return;

    //  Creation of an array x, which contains the 3 variables x0,x1,x2;
    //  .....

    // ViewArray<IntView> xv(home,x); 
    // GECODE_ES_FAIL(home, NewConstraint::Diff<IntView>::post(home,xv)); 
  }
}

To post the constraint  i need to create a ViewArray, but i don't understand
how to create an IntVarArg  containing these variables ?

Thank you.

Amina

Hi,

 

Argument arrays are meant for what they are called: passing arguments as is
explained in detail in Section 4.2.2 in Modeling with Gecode. Using them for
other purposes is a bad idea and hence they do not have a new operator by
design! 

 

What you should do is use a different data structure and create and argument
array just when you need it for posting a propagator or branching.

    I want to create an object of IntArgs in my program dynamically. For
instance " IntArgs *pt = new IntArgs(4); -----create an object of IntArgs
with four elements" or

"IntArgs *pt = new IntArgs [10];------create an array with 10 object of
IntArgs." They all be compiled with errors. And i haven't seen the examples

Gecode support to create object of Gecode class ? And how ?

Hi,



what?s wrong with creating a new array each time you need it? They are very
fast to create (they will only allocate heap memory if the array is large
and otherwise, creation is super-quick). I have to admit I still don?t see
really what you mean by uncertain number.

hi,
    Now let me talk about what i want to do. I have a lot of data,and i need
to copy some data into the variable of the " IntArgs ". The number of
variables what i want is uncertain,which is controlled by an outside
parameter. And these variables include different data.
    For instance, i have an 10*10 Array data. Now i want to copy the second
,the fifth and the sixth column of Array data into three variables of
"IntArgs". In my project, the number of  variables of "IntArgs" what i need
and which columns of Array data i want to copy are all uncertain,controlled
by parameters. So this case make me to search for an dynamical method to
create variable of the "IntArgs" . But "IntArgs" do not have a new operator
by design. So i have to change the way and create an certain number of
variables of the "IntArgs",which is larger than actual need. You know that
wasting memory is an obvious disadvantage of this way.
     whether there has an better way to resolve this problem?

Hi Kayler,

you should not use IntArgs for representing your data, only for  
posting constraints.  So, when you read in your data, just use e.g.  
normal integer vectors.  Then you post the constraints, and you know  
exactly how many you need.  For each posted constraint, you construct  
the corresponding IntArgs from the data vectors.  That's their  
purpose, don't use them for storing data.

Again, what?s wrong with creating an new argument array of exactly the
right size when you need it? That doesn?t waste memory!

hi,

    Now let me talk about what i want to do. I have a lot of data,and i need
to copy some data into the variable of the " IntArgs ". The number of
variables what i want is uncertain,which is controlled by an outside
parameter. And these variables include different data.

    For instance, i have an 10*10 Array data. Now i want to copy the second
,the fifth and the sixth column of Array data into three variables of
"IntArgs". In my project, the number of  variables of "IntArgs" what i need
and which columns of Array data i want to copy are all uncertain,controlled
by parameters. So this case make me to search for an dynamical method to
create variable of the "IntArgs" . But "IntArgs" do not have a new operator
by design. So i have to change the way and create an certain number of
variables of the "IntArgs",which is larger than actual need. You know that
wasting memory is an obvious disadvantage of this way.

     whether there has an better way to resolve this problem?

Hi,



what?s wrong with creating a new array each time you need it? They are very
fast to create (they will only allocate heap memory if the array is large
and otherwise, creation is super-quick). I have to admit I still don?t see
really what you mean by uncertain number.



Best

Christian

hi,

   Your said about using Argument arrays are right . The purpose i use
Argument arrays to do is also just as it should to be . What i want to do is
that I want to use uncertain number of Argument Arrays ,so i want to  create
Argument arrays dynamically. You said that they do not have a new operator
by design ,so i can't use "new" way. I maybe create an certain number of
Argument Arrays which is much more than i want ,and it may waste some
memories. Whether there has another way to realize my thought?

welcome to talk about it.



Kayler.

Hi,



Argument arrays are meant for what they are called: passing arguments as is
explained in detail in Section 4.2.2 in Modeling with Gecode. Using them for
other purposes is a bad idea and hence they do not have a new operator by
design!



What you should do is use a different data structure and create and argument
array just when you need it for posting a propagator or branching.

hi,

  And i find that "Gecode::Support::DynamicArray< T, A > Class Template"
maybe can realize it. But i did it  unsuccessfully.

Who can give me right answer.

hi?

    I want to create an object of IntArgs in my program dynamically. For
instance " IntArgs *pt = new IntArgs(4); -----create an object of IntArgs
with four elements" or

"IntArgs *pt = new IntArgs [10];------create an array with 10 object of
IntArgs." They all be compiled with errors. And i haven't seen the examples
of create object dynamically in Gecode. And I want to know whether the
Gecode support to create object of Gecode class ? And how ?

Look forward to your reply!



Kayler

Just fill the array manually, no need for IntVarArgs:

xv[0] = x0; xv[1] = x1; xv[2] = x2;

Or change the definition of the NewConstraint class to take three  
views instead of one ViewArray.
