<PRE>Hmmm,

the first five lines in the patch look already fishy:

--- gecode/int/bool/clause.hpp	2009-10-14 12:19:49.000000000 +0200
+++ gecode/int/bool/clause.hpp	2009-12-13 23:46:53.000000000 +0100
@@ -50,6 +50,8 @@
   (home,x0[x0.size()-1],y0[y0.size()-1]), x(x0), y(y0) {
     assert((x.size() &gt; 0) &amp;&amp; (y.size() &gt; 0));
     x.size(x.size()-1); y.size(y.size()-1);
+    x0.subscribe(home,*this,PC_BOOL_SAME,false);
+    x1.subscribe(home,*this,PC_BOOL_SAME,false);
   }

Here x0 in x0.subscribe refers to the argument passed to the constructor.
You assume it refers to the member, right?

Yep ;-)

Subject: [gecode-users] Propagation condition and cloning

Hi Everyone,

I would like to put another Propagation Condition in BoolVarImp. You gave me
good advice on how to process. For a first step, I just wanted to make some
test. So I first modified bool.vis and add this new Propagation Condition.
Then I tried to make existing propagators subscribe to this new propagation
condition (without scheduling propagators and sending the corresponding
events). Unfortunately, I failed to achieved this first step. Indeed, some
problems occur during cloning.

I first thought that It was a problem with the rewriting of propagator
during cloning. Indeed, I didn't update all propagators, so it can't be
possible to change a propagator by another one which doesn't subscribe to
the same propagation conditions than the original one. 
I disabled the rewrite of a propagator by another propagator from a
different class during cloning. But I still have problems. I tried many
things, without success and now I have no more ideas.

For now, I just want to understand why I can't make it work. For this
purpose, I designed an example to make gecode crash. I used the &quot;sat&quot;
example given with Gecode, and only deal with this example (no matter if the
other examples don't work anymore).
My problem is reproducible by applying the patch attached in this mail to
Gecode 3.2.2. Then, I configured and compiled Gecode with the following
commands:

./configure --enable-debug --enable-audit make

The test problem can be launched by copying the test2.cnf file (attached in
the mail) in the gecode directory and executing the command:
./examples/sat test2.cnf

If I use a debugger I get:

Program received signal EXC_BAD_ACCESS, Could not access memory.

I probably made an obvious mistake, but I can not see.
Thanks for your help,
