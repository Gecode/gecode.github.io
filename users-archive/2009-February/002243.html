Sorry, DDS was planned to be included in 3.0, but it won't make it, as  
the implementation relied on reflection, which won't be in 3.0.  The  
problem is that the decomposition analysis has to look at the  
constraint graph, and so far reflection was the only way to implement  
that (and not a very efficient way after all).

We have several other analyses that we hope to integrate in a future  
version of Gecode, but we first have to come up with a simple and  
efficient interface to the constraint graph.

Yes, in principle it will work with a custom branching, as long as it  
is a ViewValBranching.  DDS was actually implemented as a wrapper  
branching around a ViewValBranching.

&gt;<i> Is there any simple way to measure the 'decomposability' of my

</I>&gt;<i> small independent sub-problems as search proceeds, but it is too large

You could check out revision 8076 of the trunk.  That revision should  
have a working version of DDS (though it's not fully tested).  You can  
take the function connectedComponents from gecode/dds/decomposing- 
branching.hpp to analyse your problem, e.g. every time your copy  
function is called.

Cheers,
	Guido
