<PRE>Hi Vincent,

would the following help: There will be two iterators Space::Propagators and
Space::Branchings that iterate over all propagators or branchings of a
space? Would be enough if they would just give const access?

Your patch is wrong. The update function does everything thats needed. Or
did you have a problem there?

Cheers
Christian

Hi,

Le mardi 10 f&#233;vrier 2009 14:52:37 Christian Schulte, vous avez &#233;crit :
&gt;<i> Hi,
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> no there is no way to find the x, in particular as some branchings 
</I>&gt;<i> might not have an array of variables.
</I>
I wasn't sure but I suspected it.

&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> There is not even the notion of a current branching (there are two 
</I>&gt;<i> current
</I>&gt;<i> branchings: one that is used for status() and the other that is used 
</I>&gt;<i> for
</I>&gt;<i> commit() during recomputation).
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Branchings are designed to just implement a particular interface that's
</I>it.
&gt;<i>
</I>
It is not completely clear for me. I will look more further in the code.

&gt;<i> Maybe you tell us what you want to do?
</I>
I have created a new variable type and I want to do backjumping on the
search tree. So I need to access to the variable of the BranchingDesc to
know if I must to skip the BranchingDesc or not. After reading your mail, I
decided to create sub-class of ViewValBranching and PosValDesc to get the
information I need. Here comes a piece of the code I wrote in my search
engine:

              const BranchingDesc * bd;
              int noAlt;
              int noClosedDesc;
              QBool::QBoolQuant quant;
              do
              {
                bd = rcs.nextDesc&lt; QBool::QBoolPosValDesc&lt;2&gt; 
&gt;<i>(*this,noAlt,noClosedDesc);
</I>                if (bd == NULL) return NULL;
                quant = static_cast&lt;const QBool::QBoolPosValDesc&lt;2&gt;*&gt;(bd)-
&gt;<i>quantifier();
</I>              } while (quant != QBool::QBoolVarImp::EXISTS);

              delete cur;
              cur = rcs.recompute&lt;false&gt;(d,*this);
              EngineCtrl::current(cur);

Sometimes, the line:
&quot;              } while (quant != QBool::QBoolVarImp::EXISTS);&quot;
changes, so I have to dynamically ask the variable of the BranchingDesc what
is its quantifier.

The problem here is that I have to assume that it is a
QBool::QBoolPosValDesc&lt;2&gt; BranchingDesc and to cast it.
I would like to test if it is a QBool::QBoolPosValDesc&lt;2&gt; and if it is the
case, to test its quantifier.

&gt;<i> Then, reflection will be gone (see my next mail as to why) and there 
</I>&gt;<i> is currently no way to get the actors (unless you iterate over the 
</I>&gt;<i> list of actors, check how the function propagators() counting the 
</I>&gt;<i> number of propagators is implemented).
</I>
I looked at propagators(), but It needs &quot;pc&quot; being public or protected in
order to use it in our subclass of Space.

Another thing, I am not sure it's a small bug or not, but I found that the
&quot;co&quot; field of SpeedLinBoolInt is not initialized during cloning. As a
result, the update function of Council&lt;A&gt; may not ends. I attached a patch
in the mail.

Thank you for your help.
Cheers,
Vincent
