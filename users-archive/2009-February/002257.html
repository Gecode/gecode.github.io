<PRE>Dear Malcolm,

you're right, the examples are not very helpful as a starting point.   
However, the tutorial documentation we're currently writing (and which  
is going to be available soon) will provide exactly the kind of  
information you're asking for.  The new tutorial examples will be self- 
contained and explained step by step, and the document will cover  
everything that is essential for modeling with Gecode (creating  
variables, posting constraints, search, and compiling/linking).

Cheers,
	Guido

</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> If you do this, it would make like easier for all of us. Users such as
