<PRE>Actually, that is weird as in the examples also setup time is measured. But
I fear you have to chip in some more detail what you do.

 

The runtime between 1* and 2* should be roughly the same (why do you compare
one old version against another old version, 2.1.1 is not the latest). But
the statistics can be trusted, we use it all the time and we know that it
does not deviate from the OS measures.

Subject: [gecode-users] another question about stats

 

I made a small testing sample, I made a simple propagator and some variables
subscribing to it.
Inside the propagate method there is a usleep line, which is supposed to
delay the execution for some seconds.
When I run the example, the delay is there, however when  stats are shown,
they say the example`s runtime was 0ms.
what does &quot;runtime&quot; measure? am I doing  anything wrong?
Also, Im making performance comparisons between some programs on Gecode old
versions and between the same ones on Gecode 2.1.1,
I wonder whether I should  measure the time on my own or just use the
runtime thrown by gecode`s stats

Thank you in advance!
