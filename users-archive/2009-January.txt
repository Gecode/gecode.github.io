Subject: [gecode-users] Number of iterations.
Message-ID: <3cf38b4d0901050838r4b2e57eew7beb0766e889db38@mail.gmail.com>

Hi!
Please let me know how many iterations does gecode when no iteration number
are specified and if it is not a problem explain me what exactly an
iteration is.
For example if i pass "opt.iterations(50);" to the engine it does 50
iterations, thats obvious, but what if a comment that line.

Thank you, and happy new year from Jacksonville, FL.

Message-ID: <e7b0e5a40901060801y5be5fd2fgb051d05c6744fbfb@mail.gmail.com>

Hello all,

I have a question regarding the specification for variable base
implementation in gecode. As far as i can see, there is some code in the
gecode kernel which  is automatically generated from *.vis files.
Modification events and propagation conditions are defined in this kind of
files. I am implementing a new variable type and i want to be sure i am
doing it in the right way, so here is my question:

- There are some special words to define modification events: FAILED, NONE,
ASSIGNED and SUBSCRIBE. I am fine with the first three of them because it is
straight forward what they mean. However the fourth one is not clear to me.
According with the documentation (int.vis) SUBSCRIBE is used the first time
a propagator subscription is processed. Does it means that after the first
execution of the propagator, it will subscribe using the propagation
conditions specified in its class definition?.  In my particular case, i
have only 3 modification events apart from the generic ones: lower bound
modification, upper bound modification and both bounds modification events.
I defined the last one (called ME_GRAPH_BB in my implementation) to be the
one equal to the word SUBSCRIBE.

For this case, if a propagator P subscribes to the propagation condition
PC_GRAPH_GLB (i.e. class SomeProp : public UnaryProp<View,PC_GRAPH_GLB>
...), what is the effect of ME_GRAPH_BB=SUBSCRIBE with respect to other
possible definition such as ME_GRAPH_GLB=SUBSCRIBE?

thanks in advance,

Gustavo.

Hi,

There is no built-in container representing multidimensional arrays.
To access standard arrays as matrices, there is a wrapper class called
Matrix in MiniModel (see the Sudoku and Magic square examples). You
can also roll your own accessors (see the BIBD example).

Cheers,
Mikael

Hi,

When a propagator subscribes to some variables, it will be scheduled
for propagation. When a propagator runs it gets a ModEventDelta that
has the strongest modification event describing the changes since the
last run of the propagator. For newly created propagators that just
subscribed to some variables there is no previous run of the
propagator, so there is no delta to supply. The SUBSCRIBE modification
event is the modification event used as the delta when scheduling the
propagator. For integer variables it is ME_INT_BND (passing ME_INT_DOM
would imply that no bounds reasoning was needed), and for set
variables it is CBB (both bounds and the cardinality has changed).

Hope this helps,
Mikael

Hi Denys,

well the principle was: just make them general enough so that it works for
the cases we use in Gecode... Do you want them more general than that?

Hello,

I am running my code against the latest SVN version (r8036) and have the  
following bizar problem:
I am looking for all solutions that adhere to a set of constraints. The  
search happens over one array of boolean decision variables, and all the  
constraints are put on different subsets of this array.

For a certain input datadaset, running the model returns 500 results. If I  
run the same model using GIST (-mode gist), it returns 508 results ! After  
manual verification, there are 508 results that satisfy all the  
constraints. The 8 results that are missing form a complete branch in the  
GIST search tree.

I can't create a small example to reproduce it, but it happens everytime  
on my model for that dataset... Do you have any idea how this is possible ?

Hi Tias,

what constraints are used (in particular anything you implemented yourself)?
Does it happen if you switch off recomputation (passing -c-d 1 on the
command line or setting c_d in the search options to 1)?

Could you run it against 2.2.0?

Otherwise, we would need your code to have a look.

Cheers

Actually, as a user of Gecode, I had remained sofar completely oblivious
to these design oddities.  However, I have been developing a new family
of constraints, and, as an implementor, I have to make design decisions.
I went to the existing code for guidance and I got confused: it didn't
seem to follow a very clear design paradigm.  That's why I asked.  Also:
is there a downside to providing the most general templates?

Hi all,

 I was wondering what the number of failures output at the end of a run means.
The documentation says that it's the number of failed nodes in the search tree;
is that the nodes where the solver backtracks or all nodes visited which are not
part of a solution? Is there any way to get the total number of search tree
nodes visited during search?

Thanks,

Hi,

The number of failures is the standard measure used in CP: the number
of times a failure is detected (i.e., the number of failed leaves in
the tree). In the next version of Gecode we have added a counter for
the number of nodes in the search tree in addition. If you want this
information now for some problem, you can also run Gist.

Cheers,
Mikael

There is actually a downside (although it's not the reason we didn't  
provide the templates).  If you use the ModEventDelta during  
propagation, you have to access it through all the view types of the  
propagator and combine the results.  The more types you allow, the  
less accurate is the ModEventDelta.  E.g., if you get ME_SET_GLB, but  
you use one SetView and one ComplementView, the combined delta is  
ME_SET_BB (and you have to compute the combined ModEventDelta yourself).

Cheers,
	Guido

If you set the c-d parameter to 1, I think the number of clones equals 
the number of nodes explored (maybe plus or minus 1 or 2 or so...)

According to the manual, this will make the number of clones equal to the number

Right, my mistake. The number of commits plus one should be the right 
number. For an exhausted binary search tree, the number of clones seems 
to be about half that (which makes sense assuming the optimisation that 
a clone is only created for one of the branches, and the other commit 
applied directly to the parent node).

On an example that is small enough to view in Gist, I get a (binary) 
search tree with 14 leaf nodes (all failed, since the problem is 
unsolvable) and 13 internal nodes. The statistics for this tree are:

Failed: 14
Clones: 13 (one for every node that has a child / two children)
Commits: 26 (one for every node except the root).

If c-d is greater than 1, the number of commits goes up.

Again, just approximately. Your best bet would be to use Gist.

According to the manual, this will make the number of clones equal to the
number
of commits (a clone is created for every commit) -- is the number of commits
equivalent to the number of nodes?

Subject: [gecode-users] how to start?
Message-ID: <20090108185500.GA5085@cs-wsok.swansea.ac.uk>

Hello,

I'm relatively familiar with the concepts of
constraint satisfaction and constraint programming
(say, at the level of [Dechter, Constraint Processing],
[Apt, Principles of Constraint Programming], or
[Handbook of Constraint Programming], however
when trying to get into Gecode, then I'm lost:
I even don't know what it's all about?

At
http://www.gecode.org/gecode-doc-latest/index.html
one finds under "Getting started" how to install it
(no problem), some notational convention (which I
somehow can imagine what it wants to say, but which
seems at this point rather irrelevant), and then
we have the glossary, which seems rather circular
to me, and which doesn't say much when you are not
already familiar with the library.

That seems to be it: "Programming tasks" seem to speak 
only about some specifics (again, if the whole is not known
that it doesn't seem to make so much sense), and the rest
looks alike.

So where to start?? Is there no definition of the whole problem
area (what kind of "constraint satisfaction problems" are
considered?), the basic algorithms supported (there are quite
a few algorithmic models out there), what are the basic abstraction
about "variables, values, constraints" (abstract data types)?

Perhaps Gecode assumes familiarity with some other CSP-library?
I'm coming from the SAT world, and I'm not aware of any other
framework than Gecode (which could be used as a role model).

Of course, I could start with some examples, but there seem to
be no complete examples, just classes (like http://www.gecode.org/gecode-doc-latest/classGraphColor.html;
I guessed that graph colouring would be rather easy), which don't say
much without the framework.

At http://www.gecode.org/gecode-doc-latest/group__Example.html it says
"All scripts are compiled into simple standalone programs. ", but I don't understand
what "script" here means? Clicking on "Scripts for problems" I only get
some (specific) classes?

Perhaps one needs to search for those files in the installed library?
(Somehow I'm of the old-fashioned opinion that documentation should be
somehow self-contained.)
But for example "graph-color.cc" doesn't give definitions/explanations (about the
concepts involved)? It all seems to assume that the basic concepts are known.


This is now my second attempt to gain a bit of familiarity with Gecode, but
I can't find no bridge.
Is it necessary to start reading the source code, looking at all the examples,
and deciphering myself what are the underlying concepts?

Perhaps there is some fundamental piece of documentation I'm missing.
Or, if not, then I would guess it wouldn't be too hard to outline
somewhere the basic concepts (from an abstract point of view).
Once one knows the main direction, then guessing what examples
and code fragments could mean becomes much easier.

Hoping for some hints

Confused Oliver

Look at gecode/set/rel/eq.hpp:94.  The Eq propagator has two views,  
and its propagate method gets the ModEventDelta med, which describes  
the cumulated modifications (on all subscribed variables) since the  
last invocation.  Now assume the lower bounds of the two subscribed  
variables x and y have been modified.  Then med is ME_SET_GLB.  So the  
propagator knows that it just has to perform the lower bound  
reasoning, it can skip the other inferences.  That's what's determined  
by the testSetEventLB etc functions.

Now if Eq is instantiated with a SetView on x and a ComplementView on  
y, it still gets ME_SET_GLB as the med (because the kernel doesn't  
know about the views).  So Eq asks the views to translate the med (in  
lines 96 and 97).  The SetView just returns ME_SET_GLB, and the  
ComplementView returns ME_SET_LUB (because a glb change in y  
corresponds to a lub change in its complement).  So we'll have to do  
lub reasoning as well.

Now assume that only the glb of x has changed.  Still, the med must be  
converted through both views (we don't know which of the two views has  
the changed domain), and we'll have to run the lub propagation  
although it won't contribute any pruning.

Cheers,
	Guido

Hi,

The documentation for Gecode is a reference documentation, there is
currently no tutorial-style documentation. See previous discussion on
the mailing list [1].

As for learning to use Gecode, I would recommend to start learning by
doing a few simple models. All the examples in the examples-directory
are full programs (hint: each file has a main-function), so they are a
good starting point for exploration. I would recommend starting by
studying a simple example like n-queens (examples/queens.cc) or
send+more=money (examples/money.cc). Gecode uses mostly the same
concepts as other CP-systems, so the modeling-part is quite similar.
For detailed information about the constraints and variables that you
can use, the relevant sections in the reference-documentation are
under Programming Models [2].

Cheers,
Mikael

PS A script refers to a model.

Hello,

I am experiencing almost the same problem. There is a difference in the
number of solutions when i run my problem instance with or without gist. The
difference with the case reported is that for me the number of solutions
reported by gist is really large compared to the number of solutions of the
command line search. In my case the search without gist reports the right
number of solutions.

As i am working with a new constraint system i think this is caused by some
bug in my implementation, but the question is: if it is a bug then both
search strategies should exhibit it, am i right?

Thanks in advance,
Gustavo

Not necessarily.  If it's due to non-monotonicity of a propagator,  
anything can happen - the shape and size of the tree might even depend  
on memory layout and other influences that are impossible to control.   
If the propagator is in addition not correct, also the number of  
solutions can differ substantially.
In your case, does Gist return solutions that shouldn't be accepted as  
solutions, or does it return solutions more than once?

Cheers,
	Guido

I removed all the propagators from my problem. Currently i am only branching
on one variable and i am getting different result from gist and the other
search. As there are no propagators, the shape of the search tree is easy
to guess and should have only 80 solutions. When i run the gist search i get
more than that number of solutions but an interesting thing is that clicking
or passing the mouse over a solution that should not be there leads to a
segmentation fault. Actual solutions to the problem are shown when double
clicking without any problem.

Could you please send me the code (by private email)?  I'll check, but  
it sounds like a bug in Gist.  Do you use a custom branching?

Message-ID: <43d9f1650901090246i748245aq6d6a501c40928786@mail.gmail.com>

How to defining constraint to extract Element from an array of integer
holding repeated values?
Gecode provide ElementUnion function to extract elements from IntSet or
VarSet.
How about an integer array in which elements may hold the same values?

Below is a hypothesized problem that needs such capabilities:

Assign n number of students into 3 groups.
each student is teach by a certain instructor.

I'd like to evenly distributed the students into the groups (assume the
total no. of student is divisible by the 3 groups.)
Given an array where the 1st element holds the instructor (in enum) of the
1st student and so on...

How should I model the constratint to enforce that:
     for each group, the total no. of distinct instructors are the same.

?? Big Big thanks!

What's an IntValArray?

What's a SetVarGlbValue?

All three statements should do the same thing.  However, I don't  
understand what d.val() is, and if d is an IntVar, you cannot use its  
value when posting constraints, as the value will only be determined  
after solving the problem.

If I understand the problem correctly, the mapping from student to  
instructor is given in advance, as an array mapping student id to  
instructor id.  Then a model for this problem may look as follows:

Use a SetVarArray group, so that group[i] is the set of students in  
group i.  Now we have to map from students to instructors.  For this,  
we use the elementsUnion constraint with IntSetArgs.  Construct the  
IntSetArgs isa such that isa[j] is an IntSet that contains as the  
single element the instructor of student number j.  Then
elementsUnion(this, isa, group[i], x) will bind x to the set of  
instructors of group i.  Using cardinality(this, x,y) constrains an  
IntVar y to the cardinality of x.  So balancing all the y (one for  
each group) solves the problem.

Hope this helps,

	Guido

Subject: [gecode-users] DDS in trunk version : does distinct support

Message-ID: <496CD933.7080408@informatik.uni-freiburg.de>


Hi,

I am preparing and updating my code for the next release of Gecode to 
utilize DDS. For that I update everything to work with the current trunk.

An important question for me at this point: Is the distinct propagator 
self-decomposing to work properly with DDS or do I've got to come up 
with a 'hacked' version. :)
And concerning that: do you have plans for a set of DDS-dedicated 
self-decomposing propagators or a module for this?

Furthermore, in the current trunk the DDS module is not working and 
stops compilation on my machine. Is the module stable or currently under 
construction? So do I've got to search for the problem on my machine or 
just wait for some time for the final changes?

Thanks for your help,

Martin

PS. btw any release plans for 3.0? ;) I wont give up ... *grin*

Distinct does not self-decompose.  As we don't have any special DDS  
propagators, there's no module, but there could be if we had any.

It's been broken since the new design for branchings.  I'll try to fix  
it.

Hello,

I am working on a scheduling problem. On the instances I have to deal
with, I can reach a number of constraints of 500 000. During the search
process, the memory usage is very high, which eventually renders my operating
system unstable. Is it possible to solve this problem ? How ? 

I am not sure to understand the update method. I use many auxilliary
variables in my model. Must they all be copied in the update method ?

Of course, the problem may come from my model itself...

Thanks in advance.

For constructing an IntSetArgs with instructorOfStudent[], below is the way I used.
It seems a bit stupid to put the instructorOfStudent[] into a tmpValue[1] in order to use the constructor.
Is there are smarter way to do so?

Yes, IntSet(i,i) constructs the singleton set {i} (see the  
documentation).

500000 constraints is definitely a lot.  One way to save memory (which  
would also help performance) is to try remodeling with global  
constraints - of course, that depends on whether there are suitable  
global constraints for your problem.  The second thing you could try  
is to play with the recomputation parameters c-d and a-d.

For experimenting, I'd suggest limiting the amount of memory the OS  
may allocate to the process, so that you can always safely terminate  
it.  On unix systems, you can use the ulimit command (maybe there's  
something similar for Windows, too).

You only have to copy the variables that constitute the solution, e.g.  
those that you want to output.

The only requirement is to inherit from BranchingDesc.  Then you put  
everything in the object that you need for the commit operation.

> What is the role of the
> size() method?

It's used for keeping track of the overall allocated memory (in engine- 
ctrl.hpp:70).  As BranchingDescs are allocated on the heap (in  
contrast to the space), their memory has to be counted extra.

> If my Branching::description() allocates a new
> BranchingDesc, when/where should it be deleted?

It's owned by whoever requests the description.  Usually,  
description() is called by a search engine, so the search engines own  
and delete the BranchingDescs (e.g. reco-stack.hpp:82).

Subject: [gecode-users] Extra information during propagation
Message-ID: <200901201245.37474.Vincent.Barichard@univ-angers.fr>

Hi,

I try to make a propagator that needs more extra information during 
propagation, but I'm not sure of how to proceed.

For example :

At the begining of the propagation I have a propagator named p2 which reduces 
domains of a,c,d:

p2(a,c,b)

After some propagation steps, a new propagator is posted (during the 
propagation). This new propagator ensures that: a == b

For my problem, the equality of domains is no sufficient, I really needs to know 
in the propagation that 'a' is equivalent to 'b'.
Of course p2 is scheduled, but p2 also needs to know that 'a' and 'b' are 
equals to reduce the domain of 'c'. So I want to rewrite p2 by replacing 'a' 
with 'b'. It consists in subsuming p2 and posting the new propagator 
p2'(b,c,b) .

I think about two ways of doing this :

First way:
When the propagator 'a == b' is posted (subscribed), it rewrites all the 
propagators which can deal with the equality of two variables 'a' and 'b'. But 
I needs to know the class of the propagator (only some propagators will be 
able to be rewritten). Is there a way to know (properly) the kind (class) of a 
propagator? 

Second way:
A new ModEvent will be emitted during propagation when two variables are 
equals. Propagators will deal with this event and will rewrite themselves 
(subsume + post). But during Propagation, extra information is needed (to know 
with which variable the equality has been found). So I think about advisors 
and read the article "Advisors for Incremental Propagation" but it is said 
that the result of propagation is independent of the state. The problem is 
that if the extra information is not provided, the result of propagation will 
be different. Indeed, if the propagator doesn't know that 'a == b', it will 
lead to less reducing. Can I still use advisors?

I don't want to make a quick dirty hack (by changing the GeCode code). So how 
do you proceed if you will have to deal with it?

I hope that I made myself clear enough.
I will really appreciate any advice. Thanks.

I've written a custom branching and I am trying to write some unit  
tests to make sure it is working properly. As such, I am doing the  
branching and propagation process step-by-step, but there is something  
wrong with my code. I have:

	ConcretePlanSpace *space = new ConcretePlanSpace(graph, 1, 10);
	ConcretePlanBranching *branching = new (space)  
ConcretePlanBranching(space);

	assert(space->status() == SS_BRANCH);

	const BranchingDesc* desc = space->description();
	space->commit(desc, 0);

	assert(space->status() == SS_BRANCH);

That much of the code works fine, but I want to create a clone of the  
space to test out different alternatives:

	Space* copy = space->clone(false);
	desc = copy->description();
	copy->commit(desc, 0);

When it gets to commit() the code fails. GDB shows:

Program received signal EXC_BAD_ACCESS, Could not access memory.
Reason: KERN_PROTECTION_FAILURE at address: 0x0000000b
0x001d1e0b in Gecode::Space::commit (this=0xf17460, d=0x7, a=0) at

330         while ((b_commit != Branching::cast(&a_actors)) &&

Any ideas what I am doing wrong?

Thanks,

Hi,

While I'm not sure about the exact reason for your failure (especially
without seeing your code), it could be that you call the wrong
Branching-constructor in your copy constructor. See the example custom
branchings in examples/black-hole.cc and examples/queen-armies.cc for
guidance.

Cheers,
Mikael

Yes, I was following those examples. My code for the space is:


ConcretePlanSpace::ConcretePlanSpace(Graph *graph, int nRobots, int  
maxLength) :
	Space(), myPlan(this, graph, nRobots, maxLength, true) {

}

ConcretePlanSpace::ConcretePlanSpace(bool share, ConcretePlanSpace  
&space) :
	Space(share, space) {
	myPlan.update(this, share, space.myPlan);
}

ConcretePlanSpace::~ConcretePlanSpace() {
	// TODO Auto-generated destructor stub
}

Space* ConcretePlanSpace::copy (bool share) {
	return new ConcretePlanSpace(share, *this);
}

CompletePlanVar& ConcretePlanSpace::getPlan() {
	return myPlan;
}

First of all, I meant the copy constructor in your custom branching.

Secondly, I re-read your originally posted code, and saw that you use
the status/description/commit interface erroneously. From the
documentation of description [1]:
    "This member function can only be called after the member
     function Space::status on the same space has been called
     and in between no non-const member function has been
     called on this space."

Cheers,
Mikael

Hi Vincent,

basically you want to have equivalence (or even equality) reasoning in
Gecode. Gecode has been explicitly designed to not deal with it. Prior
systems (logic programming based systems such as SICStus, Eclipse, Mozart,
...) do have equality reasoning (but typically with lots of restrictions if
not bugs). However my own experience has been that it is not useful enough
(from a general perspective) and the chosen implementation technology
(maintaining equivalence classes) is totally ill matched to performing
propagation efficiently.

What would be possible on a general level is to use a substitution based
approach. We know how to do it but it is a lot of work.

Okay that was just the background info and the answer that there is no
general way and just fixing something in Gecode will not do the trick.

Then what you might want to do is to define a new type of variables yourself
that just extends Gecode variables by an additional level of indirection to
do equivalence reasoning.

Hope that helps
Christian

Subject: [gecode-users] Extra information during propagation

Hi,

I try to make a propagator that needs more extra information during 
propagation, but I'm not sure of how to proceed.

For example :

At the begining of the propagation I have a propagator named p2 which
reduces 
domains of a,c,d:

p2(a,c,b)

After some propagation steps, a new propagator is posted (during the 
propagation). This new propagator ensures that: a == b

For my problem, the equality of domains is no sufficient, I really needs to
know 
in the propagation that 'a' is equivalent to 'b'.
Of course p2 is scheduled, but p2 also needs to know that 'a' and 'b' are 
equals to reduce the domain of 'c'. So I want to rewrite p2 by replacing 'a'

with 'b'. It consists in subsuming p2 and posting the new propagator 
p2'(b,c,b) .

I think about two ways of doing this :

First way:
When the propagator 'a == b' is posted (subscribed), it rewrites all the 
propagators which can deal with the equality of two variables 'a' and 'b'.
But 
I needs to know the class of the propagator (only some propagators will be 
able to be rewritten). Is there a way to know (properly) the kind (class) of
a 
propagator? 

Second way:
A new ModEvent will be emitted during propagation when two variables are 
equals. Propagators will deal with this event and will rewrite themselves 
(subsume + post). But during Propagation, extra information is needed (to
know 
with which variable the equality has been found). So I think about advisors 
and read the article "Advisors for Incremental Propagation" but it is said 
that the result of propagation is independent of the state. The problem is 
that if the extra information is not provided, the result of propagation
will 
be different. Indeed, if the propagator doesn't know that 'a == b', it will 
lead to less reducing. Can I still use advisors?

I don't want to make a quick dirty hack (by changing the GeCode code). So
how 
do you proceed if you will have to deal with it?

I hope that I made myself clear enough.
I will really appreciate any advice. Thanks.

Subject: [gecode-users] Interfacing GeCode to ECLiPSe
Message-ID: <49770B98.7030105@cisco.com>

Hi,

We have been thinking about developing an interface to GeCode for the 
Constraint Logic Programming language ECLiPSe for a while now, and 
finally I can devote some time and resource to this.

The idea is to provide an alternative FD solver for ECLiPSe, in addition 
to the existing native FD solver(s) already available.

I have been looking at the available documentation, which seems to be
mostly documentation for the procedures. I am wondering if there are
more documentations available, especially for the purpose of interfacing 
to other languages.

What I would like to do is to provide both a black-box search, i.e.
with the constraints posted by ECLiPSe to GeCode, and then the GeCode
search invoked. Secondly, I would like to do the search in ECLiPSe, with
GeCode doing the propagation. Do you think these are sensible approaches?

Thanks in advance for any help!

Cheers,

Kish

Subject: [gecode-users] Any Advise on Delta
Message-ID: <49773361.D4D3.0085.0@quintiq.com>

Christian,

in a previous conversation on 'Any Advise on assignment delta' you mentioned "the other operations that lead to 'any' are iterator-based variable domain updates which in most cases just remove a single value or a range (and hence the delta information is accurate).". Concerning this I have the following question:

I have been implementing a propagator which implements its own advise method. The intention of the advise method is to only schedule the invoking propagator if the maximum has changed. This is relatively easy to implement but I noticed that the 'delta' reporting is rather 'rough' implemented and my propagator gets scheduled quite often to conclude nothing. That is I am getting a lot of 'any' hits when there could have been more information. Specifically in my use case I have a cumulatives constraint whose propagator uses View::minus_r a lot and this propagator only reports 'any' deltas (as far as I can conclude). In the example in this e-mail clearly shows we could be more informative in the delta, it streams 1-0 (any) although I would expect 0-50. 

My question is if this is done for a reason and if so if this is done for many operators on the views?

No, there's (currently) no such documentation.  Most of the interfaces  
to Gecode use some kind of interface generator, like swig for the Java  
interface, which basically takes the C++ header files and generates  
the interfacing code.

However, interfacing is not so much different from programming models  
directly in C++.  You have to provide ways to construct a space and  
variables, and the post functions for constraints and branchings.

Alternatively, you can use the reflection API for interfacing (as done  
in gecode/serialization/javascript.{hh,cpp} and examples/ 
javascript.cpp), which has the advantage that the necessary interface  
is much smaller.

Yes, that's should be doable.  In particular the black-box approach  
should work easily.  The interaction with the ECLiPSe search should  
also be doable, but requires a little more engineering, I guess.

Hi,

In the case of cumulatives, the domain information could be reported
in a better way since singleton ranges are removed, mapping naturally
onto the integer delta abstraction. Unfortunately, this would
complicate the code for the minus_r operation, and thus it is not
clear that we will do it.

If your interest is to check if the upper bound of a variable has
changed, then caching the maximum value in the advisor is simple and
rather efficient. This is probably what I would do, and it is
independent of the delta-information that is computed.

Cheers,
Mikael

This is relatively easy to implement but I noticed that the 'delta' reporting is rather 'rough' implemented and my propagator gets scheduled quite often to conclude nothing. That is I am getting a lot of 'any' hits when there could have been more information. Specifically in my use case I have a cumulatives constraint whose propagator uses View::minus_r a lot and this propagator only reports 'any' deltas (as far as I can conclude). In the example in this e-mail clearly shows we could be more informative in the delta, it streams 1-0 (any) although I would expect 0-50.

Yes, I was following those examples. My code for the space is:


ConcretePlanSpace::ConcretePlanSpace(Graph *graph, int nRobots, int  
maxLength) :
	Space(), myPlan(this, graph, nRobots, maxLength, true) {

}

ConcretePlanSpace::ConcretePlanSpace(bool share, ConcretePlanSpace  
&space) :
	Space(share, space) {
	myPlan.update(this, share, space.myPlan);
}

ConcretePlanSpace::~ConcretePlanSpace() {
	// TODO Auto-generated destructor stub
}

Space* ConcretePlanSpace::copy (bool share) {
	return new ConcretePlanSpace(share, *this);
}

CompletePlanVar& ConcretePlanSpace::getPlan() {
	return myPlan;
}

Hi David,

I just checked the code for minus_r and I was a little surprised: I just
forgot to add the detection of this special case for minus_r, the other
iterator-based variable operations check for special cases (precisely to get
a more accurate delta). I'll jot it down to my list and it should be in
3.0.0 as it is not hard (Mikael, sorry for contradicting you here ;-) ).

Cheers
Christian

Hi all,

I'm branching over two different set of variables in my model and i'd
like to add some extra constraints in between the two branchings.  I
can think about a way to do this implementing my own search engine but
i thought it would be better to ask first for any other alternative.
I implemented both branchings myself so a modification there is easy

I agree. I don't want to perform a full equality reasoning.

That's why I think about a "rewrite" approach where propagators are rewritten 
when they detect that two of their variables are the same.

I began something like that. I have a new type of variables and propagators 
over these variables.
When a variable has been found equal to another, I post a "domain equality" 
propagator which ensures that the domains will be always equal. So, normal 
propagators will be  scheduled when domain of one of the two equal variables 
will be updated.

Furthermore, a UNIFY event is emitted. But propagators which are able to deal 
with this event have to know which are the equal variables. How to get this 
piece of information from the propagators?
I think about advisors (with the Delta parameter), but I don't know if it is 
the right choice. I also think about creating an additional field in my new 
variable type, but It will increase the size of the variable (so it will lead 
to increase the cloning time).
I am not sure of how to proceed to get the best efficiency.

> Hope that helps

Yes it helps a lot. Thank you very much.
Vincent

As I understand it, you can add multiple Branchings to a Space which  
will each be used in turn until each is satisfied. Is that correct?  
Are they applied in the order that they are added? If a Branching's  
status() returns false, is it permanently removed from the Space, or  
it is just dormant until its status() becomes true again.

I ask, because in my problem I have several different sets of  
variables and it would make my code much neater if I could have  
separate Branchings which handle each set, and which are applied  
alternately.

I don't suppose it would be too hard to write a meta-Branching which  
implemented this behaviour, but I thought I'd check what the standard  
behaviour is exactly before I go to the effort, and I can't find it  
documented anywhere.

It's permanently removed.

Right.  You'll have to go with the meta-branching.

Hmmm, I would go for more info in the variables. While Gecode's variables
are incredibly slim, a variable always will have a couple of fields (for
Booleans it is for example 5 words, for integers at least 12) that adding
one more field will not hurt much.

I was about to write that advisors will not work but maybe they will: if you
have a UNIFY event and the variable operations emit that event then advisors
should also be executed.

Honestly, what you try to do sounds very scary to me and Gecode has not been
designed with something like that in mind. But: good luck!

That's why I think about a "rewrite" approach where propagators are
rewritten 
when they detect that two of their variables are the same.

I began something like that. I have a new type of variables and propagators 
over these variables.
When a variable has been found equal to another, I post a "domain equality" 
propagator which ensures that the domains will be always equal. So, normal 
propagators will be  scheduled when domain of one of the two equal variables

will be updated.

Furthermore, a UNIFY event is emitted. But propagators which are able to
deal 
with this event have to know which are the equal variables. How to get this 
piece of information from the propagators?
I think about advisors (with the Delta parameter), but I don't know if it is

the right choice. I also think about creating an additional field in my new 
variable type, but It will increase the size of the variable (so it will
lead 
to increase the cloning time).
I am not sure of how to proceed to get the best efficiency.

> Hope that helps

Yes it helps a lot. Thank you very much.
Vincent

Hi

I am trying to restrict the values of an IntView by doing the following:
...(values is given as parameter for the method containing this code, the type is  const set<string>& )


    vector<string> v;  

    for(set<string>::const_iterator setIt = values.begin(); setIt!= values.end(); setIt++)
    {
      v.push_back(*setIt);
    }
    GECODE_AUTOARRAY(int,restrictedDoms,v.size());
    for(int i=0;i<v.size();i++)
    {
      restrictedDoms[i] = atoi(v[i].c_str());
    }
    Gecode::Iter::Values::Array restrictIterator(restrictedDoms, v.size());

    return iv.inter_v(homeFZ, restrictIterator, false);

---

I can inspect the code and see that the values contained in "restrictedDoms" are the values 1 to 10. Furthermore I can see that iv.size() is 10 (values 1 to 10) before the call to inter_v (and unassigned of course). Then after the call to inter_v, iv is assigned, and I can see that the value it is assigned to is the first value in the restrictedDoms array. 

So what am I doing wrong?

Thanks!

Andreas

p.s.  Of course it is useless to intersect a variable with domain 1 to 10 with the values 1 to 10, but still the behavior is unexpected.

I would like to try this way too and compare with the first approach. So I 
tried to understand exactly how advisors work. I looked at the "notify" 
functions in var-imp.icc and I noticed that the "schedule" function is always 
called (except for the SUBSCRIBE event). So when the advise function of a 
propagator returns ES_FIX, the propagator is still scheduled. In the comments 
just above the "advise" function it is said that when ES_FIX is returned, the 
propagator doesn't need to be run. Is it possible for an advisor (or another 
class) to cancel the scheduling of a propagator?

Furthermore, I tried to ES_SUBSUMED a propagator within its "advise" function 
but the propagator still exists when I print the actor list of the Space. 
Nevertheless, I succeeded to ES_SUBSUMED the same propagator within its 
"propagate" function. So is it possible to ES_SUBSUMED a propagator within its 
"advise" function?

Thank you for your help, I learn every day by digging inside the code of

Nope, if the advisor returns ES_FIX the propagator is _not_ scheduled!

Unscheduling a propagator is actually possible (check how it's done in
status in core.cpp, you have to unlink it and put it back in the idle queue)
but doing that is really risky: are you really really sure that the
propagator does not have to be run? And then, why bother? Just let it do a
noop.

Advisors are designed to be minimal, so you are not allowed to propagate
within them or kill off your propagator. What you do when you want to
subsume a propagator: leave a mark in the propagator's state, schedule it
(by returning ES_NOFIX in the advisor) and let the propagator then do the
subsumption.

Hi

The values were not sorted. We sorted the values before using them with 
inter_v and ?t solved the problem. :-)

I have a small follow-up question regarding advisors:

We use a series of advisors to schedule the propagator, but we are 
uncertain on what ModEvent is used, if the domain of the variable the 
advisor is attached to becomes smaller, but is still larger than 1?

Kind regards
Morten

    return iv.inter_v(homeFZ, restrictIterator, false);

---

I can inspect the code and see that the values contained in "restrictedDoms"
are the values 1 to 10. Furthermore I can see that iv.size() is 10 (values 1
to 10) before the call to inter_v (and unassigned of course). Then after the
call to inter_v, iv is assigned, and I can see that the value it is assigned
to is the first value in the restrictedDoms array. 

So what am I doing wrong?

Thanks!

Andreas

p.s.  Of course it is useless to intersect a variable with domain 1 to 10
with the values 1 to 10, but still the behavior is unexpected.

Hi Christian,

Le samedi 24 janvier 2009 11:11:44 Christian Schulte, vous avez ?crit :

Sorry, I made a confusion because of the new propagation condition that I 
created. So the propagators are scheduled because of this propagation 
condition and not because of my advisor.

I'll do that.
Thank you very much for your help. I really appreciated your advises.

Hi Christian

Below is my reply, which I have changed a little bit since the original 
reply was badly worded on my part:

The values were not sorted. We sorted the values before using them with
inter_v and ?t solved the problem.  :-)

I have a small follow-up question regarding advisors:

We use a series of advisors to schedule the propagator, but we are
uncertain on what ModEvent is used, if the domain becomes smaller, but 
is still larger than 1? That is, if the domain is reduced to size 1, the 
ModEvent is ME_GEN_ASSIGNED, but wha ModEvent is used if the size is 
decreased from e.g. 4 to 3?

Kind regards
Morten

Subject: [gecode-users] Two questions about finite set variables
Message-ID: <497D16C6.90709@anu.edu.au>


Hi,
I'm experimenting with different formulations of a problem, using finite 
set variables, and have come across two questions.

Q1: Propagation for the weights constraint. I've posted the constraint:

   weights(this, elems, costs, deleted, total_cost);

where "deleted" is an otherwise unconstrained SetVar, total_cost an 
unconstrained IntVar, and

elems = {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 
18, 19, 20}
costs = {4, 2, 4, 3, 4, 2, 2, 6, 2, 3,  1,  2,  4,  3,  4,  2,  3,  1, 
3,  3,  2}

Next, I post a cardinality constraint on deleted, saying it contains at 
least 2 and at most 3 elements. After propagation (call to status()), 
the domains of the variables are as follows:

deleted = {}..{0..20}#(2,3)
total_cost = [0..14]

So, it seems that the upper bound on the cardinality of deleted has been 
propagated to total_cost (it is at most the sum of the 3 largest costs), 
but the lower bound has not (total_cost can not be smaller than the sum 
of the 2 smallest costs, which is 2, yet the lower bound remains zero). 
This is the case also if I change the upper bound on cardinality (for 
example, if I don't put one at all, the upper bound on total_cost 
becomes 60, the sum of all the costs, but the lower bound stays zero).

Is there an explanation for this behaviour? And, more importantly, is 
there any way to change it? Since I'm trying to solve an optimisation 
problem, it is of course the lower bound on cost that is important.

Q2: When branching on in/not-in for a potential element of SetVar, what 
is the order in which the alternatives are tried? (i.e., does it explore 
the in or out branch first). And how do I change it to do the opposite?

Thanks,

Dear Morten,

thanks for reposting!

The ModEvent depends not only on size but on the type of domain: a
modification event is meant to capture how a domain changes. So for
integers:
 - If the domain has size > 1 and turns to size 1, you get ME_INT_VAL
 - If the domain has size > 1 and turns to size > 1 and either the min or
max change you get ME_INT_BND
 - Otherwise, you get ME_INT_DOM (some inner values got removed).

As you see, this depends on the variable type. You can always assume that
the value for modification event triggered on assignment equals
ME_GEN_ASSIGNED (that is, ME_INT_VAL == ME_GEN_ASSIGNED).

Hope that helps
Christian

Yes, that kind of inference was simply missing in the propagator.  The  
trunk version should do it now.

You could move to the trunk version of Gecode, or back-port the  
weights propagator (which shouldn't be too hard, you just have to take  
everything from the propagate method).

The left (first) branch includes the element, the right branch  
excludes it.  In the Gecode trunk, you also have the opposite option.

Hi Guido, Mauricio and Raffaele,

Thanks for your replies!

I am not sure what are the trade-offs between the two APIs Guido 
outlined -- is it simply that using reflection will be less flexible?

I am not very familiar with interface generators like SWIG, although I 
did take a look at it briefly several years ago, and my impression was 
that it mainly serve to map the data structures between C/C++ and the 
target language. In ECLiPSe's interface to MP solvers such as CPLEX, we 
needed to do quite a lot of extra coding in C, in addition to the data 
transformation between C and ECLiPSe, and I suspect we might require 
such extra coding for the interface to GeCode as well. In particular, I 
don't expect a direct mapping from ECLiPSe to the GeCode methods at the 
ECLiPSe level.

I expect that at the ECLiPSe level, we will use syntax that looks a lot 
like the existing syntacx for the native solvers. I expect that at a 
minimum, we would need to be able to add both constraints and variables 
dynamically. In the backbox search approach, I think we will also need 
to be able to be able to `backtrack' into the search to obtain further 
solutions after the initially one. In the case where the search is done 
by ECLiPSe, my initial thought is that we need to do only the 
propagation in GeCode, but do the search in ECLiPSe. This would mean 
that we need someway of `undoing' the effects of a propagation step, 
without directly using the search/branching facilities of GeCode. Do you 
expect that I can use Reflection API for both the black-box and the 
ECLiPSe search approach?

I have taken a brief look at the GeList wrapper that Mauricio posted 
about. I think this is not done using an interface generator, and does 
not use the Reflection mechanism. Am I correct?

If I understood Raffaele correctly, his interface generates a GeCode 
script (i.e a C++ program) from the model given in MiniZinc/SICStus,
and this C++ program is then run independently from the host language. I 
don't think this is the approach I am thinking of doing -- Instead we 
want GeCode to be run as part of an ECLiPSe execution.

Thanks and cheers,

Kish

In a way, it's more flexible.  All constraints and variable types  
available in Gecode will be automatically available through the  
interface.  When constraints or variable types are added to Gecode,  
they are available without changing the interface code (and maybe even  
without recompiling the interface).

Yes, that's how they work.  For our Java interface (which is generated  
by swig), we had to write quite some glue code, too.

Sure, that shouldn't be a problem.  Gecode is quite dynamic anyway, it  
would be an artificial restriction to make this static.

The other interfaces usually solve this by providing an object that  
represents the search, and which has a "next" method that you can call  
as often as there are solutions.  I guess you could provide a similar  
interface in Eclipse.

Right.  But Gecode does not provide a mechanism for undoing these  
effects. You can only keep a copy of a space and then redo the effects  
instead.  But this can be hidden behind some layer of abstraction.

> Do you
> expect that I can use Reflection API for both the black-box and the

Yes.  As reflection will only be used to set up the initial space, it  
should work with both approaches.

Hi Kish,

As it comes to the search interface: I have been discussing with other
LP-minded people and from these discussions I do recall the following design
outline:

Search:
 (1) Eclipse tells Gecode to create a choicepoint
 (2) Eclipse tells Gecode to backtrack until the next choicepoint (or some
choicepoint if you want it to be
     more powerful than that)

Interfacing:
 (3) Eclipse tells Gecode about variable modifications
 (4) Eclipse tells Gecode to create new variables and propagators
 (5) Eclipse instructs Gecode to do propagation and queries Gecode about
changes to variable domains 

Then, a starting point for implementing backtracking would be to just use
cloning to make it work (that should be really use but inefficient). Then,
in a second step one could use a hybrid of recomputation and cloning (just
replay what has been done by (3) and (4) and redo propagation). For a
realistic interface Gecode must use recomputation.

I think this kind of interface would be quite useful also for other
languages/systems based on backtracking. Provided that:
 - you come up with a na?ve implementation that is not Eclipse specific
(say, there will be one part that is Gecode specific and then a separate
part that is Eclipse specific, and the Gecode part can be used without
Eclipse)
 - you put the Gecode-specific part under the MIT license

We could optimize the Gecode-specific part including adding recomputation,
include the Gecode-specific part with Gecode and hence adopt and maintain
it.

What do you think?
Christian

In a way, it's more flexible.  All constraints and variable types  
available in Gecode will be automatically available through the  
interface.  When constraints or variable types are added to Gecode,  
they are available without changing the interface code (and maybe even  
without recompiling the interface).

Yes, that's how they work.  For our Java interface (which is generated  
by swig), we had to write quite some glue code, too.

Sure, that shouldn't be a problem.  Gecode is quite dynamic anyway, it  
would be an artificial restriction to make this static.

The other interfaces usually solve this by providing an object that  
represents the search, and which has a "next" method that you can call  
as often as there are solutions.  I guess you could provide a similar  
interface in Eclipse.

Right.  But Gecode does not provide a mechanism for undoing these  
effects. You can only keep a copy of a space and then redo the effects  
instead.  But this can be hidden behind some layer of abstraction.

Yes.  As reflection will only be used to set up the initial space, it  
should work with both approaches.

Hi Christian

Thank you very much for clarifying that for me. I think what confused 
me, is that the documentation on MedEvent, seen here 
http://www.gecode.org/gecode-doc-latest/group__TaskVarMEPC.html#gfa985ae465bd12df08e29252cdb7519b, 
only mentions Gecode::ME_GEN_FAILED, Gecode::ME_GEN_NONE and 
Gecode::ME_GEN_ASSIGNED.

Kind regards
Morten Boysen

Subject: [gecode-users] Branching and FlatZincGecode
Message-ID: <497E4465.3010004@itu.dk>

Hi,

I am trying to add new propagators to the FlatZincGecode space, and I 
have some question regarding this:

1) What is the defualt variable order for the FlatZincGecode space?

2) If I want to add my own branching heuristic, I believe I need to 
remove the branchings posted to the FlatZincGecode space or else my 
branching will not have any effect. Is this true?

3) I want to make a branching that follows the standard "fail-first" 
heuristic, that is, choose the value with the smallest domain possible 
and then use a special value heuristic. As I understand I need to 
implement a branching for the integer variables in the FlatZincGecode 
space and a branching for the boolean variables. If I understand it 
correctly, this means the search will process all integer variables 
first and then the boolean variables or vice verse, depending on the 
order the branching were posted to the space (the branching posted first 
is tested first). Is this correct?

Thanks,
Morten Boysen

Message-ID: <418454D1-56A3-4F5C-AFEA-EB7A2966F4CA@gmail.com>

Hi !

I am coding a little stuff that needs to extract some potential  
partial solutions from a constraint problem. To do this, I have a  
(pointer to a)Gecode::Space S with an array of IntVar, and I do the  
following :
- I have initially propared a set of IntVarArgs, each containing a  
given subset of the variables of S.
- I create S2 to be a clone of S ( via S2 = S->clone(); )
- I choose one of the IntVarArgs I initially created, let's call it  
V, and I create a new IntVarArgs V2(V);
- I update all the variables of V2 so that they "become" variables of  
S2 : for (int i=0;i<V2.size();i++)   V2[i].update(S2,true,V[i]);
- I post a branching in S2 with the variables of V2. e.g. :   
Gecode::branch(S2,V2,INT_VAR_SIZE_MIN,INT_VAL_MIN);

However, when I search on S2 (with the DFS engine), the returned  
solution do not have the corresponding variables domain reduces to a  
singleton. (I check this via an IntVar public member of my  
Gecode::Space descendant class that I did not forget to update in the  
copy constructor :-) )

I join an small example that illustrates my issue : for this problem  
with one variable and no constraints, I obtain 2 solutions (this  
number is correct), but, for both of them, the 'v' member is still  
[0..1]...

I most likely have missed something, but I don't understand what....

I am working with Gecode 2.2.0.

The problem is that you cannot use update outside the Space's copy  
constructor (or any method it calls in turn).  Copying uses forwarding  
pointers and other "magic" behind the scenes, so when you clone a  
space, some clean-up is done after all the updates.
I think for the problem you're describing, you might want to use  
arrays of indices for describing the subsets instead of using  
IntVarArgs directly.  Then you don't have to mess with update, but you  
can just create an IntVarArgs and initialize it directly from the  
IntVarArray in the space, using the indices.

Cheers,
	Guido

First branch over the IntVars with VAR_NONE, VAL_MIN, then over the  
BoolVars with NONE, VAL_MIN, then over the SetVars with NONE,  
VAL_MIN_INC.

Yes, right.  All variables will be assigned by the default branchings  
before your branching is even considered.

Yes, that's right.  For your own branching, you can reuse the  
ViewValBranching class, and instantiate it with the BySizeMin view  
selector class and your own value selector.  Then you can add support  
for that branching to the FlatZinc parser in gecode.cc, in the  
function parseSolveAnn.  That's also the place where you can disable  
the default branching.  Let us know if you need more help.

Cheers,
	Guido

After Guido's last post, I remember some of our (you, Joachim Schimpf 
and I)  discussion about this during CP a couple of years ago.

My thinking is that for ECLiPSe (and I suspect for other Prolog-like 
languages), it is difficult to be explicit about the creation of a 
choicepoint, so potentially any changes ECLiPSe tells GeCode about 
(poinys 3,4) are possible choicepoints.

After reading Guido's e-mail (but before seeing yours), I was thinking 
of maintaining a chronological list of the `events' that are sent to 
GeCode, with a counter incremented for each event. I think this 
corresponds to the `choicepoint' you mentioned. So ECLiPSe can tell 
GeCode to `backtrack' (or more properly recreate) the GeCode state when 
counter = N.

Can this be done with GeCode with the existing API, without the ECLiPSe 
side maintaining the list of events?

3) and 4) are needed for the backbox interface, because to keep close 
ECLiPSe's native finite domain solvers' semantics, propagation happens 
when a constraint is posted.

So if I use the Reflection interface, I need to be able to incrementally 
add variables and propagators.

 From our perspective, we'd like the ECLiPSe interface to be as general 
as possible, i.e. ideally we can plug in another constraint solver 
engine other than GeCode with ease.

I think your points 1) and 2) are not solver specific, and indeed can be 
used by
other backtracking languages. I guess this will be the `ECLiPSe 
specific' part,
as well as the actual 'events' themselves -- ideally I'd like the events 
to be non-GeCode specific.

Then there is the part of getting GeCode to recreate the state at a 
choicepoint/counter. This is probably specific to GeCode (or at least a 
recomputation system). As I asked earlier, can you do this with the 
GeCode APU, and if not, should the code for this be put into GeCode, 
rather than be on the `ECLiPSe side'?

ECLiPSe is now under a "Cisco style" Mozilla license (I am not a lawyer,

Hi Kish,

Creating as many choicepoints (or considering anything as a choicepoint) is
fine. No problems.

Then, all the stuff can be done with Gecode's API. So, when I talk about
shipping it with Gecode it will be one module that comes with Gecode as an
example interface. There is definitely no need for hacking inside Gecode's
guts for doing this.

Then the only thing that worries me is "Eclipse semantics requires that
constraints are immediately propagated". That you can of course do as well
(however it is a real performance killer. I luckily forgot about this major
flaw in CLP ;-) ) 

As it comes to licensing. MIT is as liberal as is gets, so no problem:
according to your license and the MIT license you can include all of Gecode
into Eclipse. The only thing interesting is that we keep and maintain one
part that's Gecode specific and you keep and maintain the Eclipse specific
part. That will require a little bit of bargaining ;-)

Christian

After Guido's last post, I remember some of our (you, Joachim Schimpf 
and I)  discussion about this during CP a couple of years ago.

My thinking is that for ECLiPSe (and I suspect for other Prolog-like 
languages), it is difficult to be explicit about the creation of a 
choicepoint, so potentially any changes ECLiPSe tells GeCode about 
(poinys 3,4) are possible choicepoints.

After reading Guido's e-mail (but before seeing yours), I was thinking 
of maintaining a chronological list of the `events' that are sent to 
GeCode, with a counter incremented for each event. I think this 
corresponds to the `choicepoint' you mentioned. So ECLiPSe can tell 
GeCode to `backtrack' (or more properly recreate) the GeCode state when 
counter = N.

Can this be done with GeCode with the existing API, without the ECLiPSe 
side maintaining the list of events?

3) and 4) are needed for the backbox interface, because to keep close 
ECLiPSe's native finite domain solvers' semantics, propagation happens 
when a constraint is posted.

So if I use the Reflection interface, I need to be able to incrementally 
add variables and propagators.

 From our perspective, we'd like the ECLiPSe interface to be as general 
as possible, i.e. ideally we can plug in another constraint solver 
engine other than GeCode with ease.

I think your points 1) and 2) are not solver specific, and indeed can be 
used by
other backtracking languages. I guess this will be the `ECLiPSe 
specific' part,
as well as the actual 'events' themselves -- ideally I'd like the events 
to be non-GeCode specific.

Then there is the part of getting GeCode to recreate the state at a 
choicepoint/counter. This is probably specific to GeCode (or at least a 
recomputation system). As I asked earlier, can you do this with the 
GeCode APU, and if not, should the code for this be put into GeCode, 
rather than be on the `ECLiPSe side'?

ECLiPSe is now under a "Cisco style" Mozilla license (I am not a lawyer, 
but I believe Cisco style means that Cisco was substituted for Mozilla 
in the license, i.e. Cisco has the right to change the licensing terms 
etc.). I guess the question of license will only kick in if some of the 
GeCode specific code needs to be kept on the ECLiPSe side (i.e. 
distributed as part of ECLiPSe). I don't know if the MIT license is 
compatible with Mozilla license (i.e. can you have a distribution with

Earlier I was advised not to use the ViewValBranching class, but to 
implement the complete branching (I originally implemented this 
branching a couple of months ago, but never got around to make it work). 
  It works now, but I am a bit unsure whether it is as efficient as the 
standard Gecode branchings (The IConfigurator class can be seen as a 
black-box, where we can get a set from with some values. We want to find 
a value, that is not in this set):

                             unsigned int a);

   // Copy a BranchingIntegers object.
   virtual Actor* copy(Space *home, bool share);

   // Add the branching strategy to the space home,
   // where the home has the IntVarArgs vars
   static void post( Space* home, IntVarArgs vars, IConfigurator* conf );

Subject: [gecode-users] Randomness in Branching
Message-ID: <579031.2451.qm@web111409.mail.gq1.yahoo.com>

As there could be a lot of solutions in an CSP, i'm looking for a way to inject randomness during the branching so that the first solution everytime I get is random.

I found a post in June 6 saying that a random branching will be provided in Gecode 3.0.x.
Is that true?

Secondly, before Gecode 3.0.x is avaliable, is there any other way I could make it?with Gecode 2.2.x?
Say, associating a random no. with each branching variable and have someway to ask Gecode to?consider?that random no.?during branching?

Is there any example that I?could make reference to??

Yes.  Random branchings (both variable and value selection) are  
available in the current trunk of Gecode.  This will become Gecode  
3.0.0 in a couple of weeks (we'll let you know some more details about  
the planned release next week).

I wouldn't bother with modifying 2.2.x now, and instead move to the  
trunk.  It's pretty stable already, we're mainly working on minor  
things that won't change the API, and on documentation.

Cheers,

They doesn't seem to be any standard notation although some of them looks like those in BST.

We do not have any documentation at this moment about Gist, right?
