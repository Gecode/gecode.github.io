Not necessarily.  If it's due to non-monotonicity of a propagator,  
anything can happen - the shape and size of the tree might even depend  
on memory layout and other influences that are impossible to control.   
If the propagator is in addition not correct, also the number of  
solutions can differ substantially.
In your case, does Gist return solutions that shouldn't be accepted as  
solutions, or does it return solutions more than once?

Cheers,
	Guido
