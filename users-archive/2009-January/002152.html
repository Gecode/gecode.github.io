I removed all the propagators from my problem. Currently i am only branching
on one variable and i am getting different result from gist and the other
search. As there are no propagators, the shape of the search tree is easy
to guess and should have only 80 solutions. When i run the gist search i get
more than that number of solutions but an interesting thing is that clicking
or passing the mouse over a solution that should not be there leads to a
segmentation fault. Actual solutions to the problem are shown when double
clicking without any problem.

Gustavo
