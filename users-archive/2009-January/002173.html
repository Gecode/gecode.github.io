<PRE>Hi,

We have been thinking about developing an interface to GeCode for the 
Constraint Logic Programming language ECLiPSe for a while now, and 
finally I can devote some time and resource to this.

The idea is to provide an alternative FD solver for ECLiPSe, in addition 
to the existing native FD solver(s) already available.

I have been looking at the available documentation, which seems to be
mostly documentation for the procedures. I am wondering if there are
more documentations available, especially for the purpose of interfacing 
to other languages.

What I would like to do is to provide both a black-box search, i.e.
with the constraints posted by ECLiPSe to GeCode, and then the GeCode
search invoked. Secondly, I would like to do the search in ECLiPSe, with
GeCode doing the propagation. Do you think these are sensible approaches?

Thanks in advance for any help!

Cheers,

Kish
