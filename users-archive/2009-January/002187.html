&gt;<i> Hmmm, I would go for more info in the variables. While Gecode's variables
</I>&gt;<i> are incredibly slim, a variable always will have a couple of fields (for
</I>&gt;<i> Booleans it is for example 5 words, for integers at least 12) that adding
</I>&gt;<i> one more field will not hurt much.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
Ok, I will add a field to store the information I need.

&gt;<i> I was about to write that advisors will not work but maybe they will: if
</I>&gt;<i> you have a UNIFY event and the variable operations emit that event then
</I>&gt;<i> advisors should also be executed.
</I>
I would like to try this way too and compare with the first approach. So I 
tried to understand exactly how advisors work. I looked at the &quot;notify&quot; 
functions in var-imp.icc and I noticed that the &quot;schedule&quot; function is always 
called (except for the SUBSCRIBE event). So when the advise function of a 
propagator returns ES_FIX, the propagator is still scheduled. In the comments 
just above the &quot;advise&quot; function it is said that when ES_FIX is returned, the 
propagator doesn't need to be run. Is it possible for an advisor (or another 
class) to cancel the scheduling of a propagator?

Furthermore, I tried to ES_SUBSUMED a propagator within its &quot;advise&quot; function 
but the propagator still exists when I print the actor list of the Space. 
Nevertheless, I succeeded to ES_SUBSUMED the same propagator within its 
&quot;propagate&quot; function. So is it possible to ES_SUBSUMED a propagator within its 
&quot;advise&quot; function?

Thank you for your help, I learn every day by digging inside the code of 
GeCode :-)

&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Honestly, what you try to do sounds very scary to me and Gecode has not
</I>&gt;<i> been designed with something like that in mind. But: good luck!
</I>
I like scary things :-)

Cheers,
Vincent

</I>&gt;<i> Hi Christian,
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Le mercredi 21 janvier 2009 10:39:22 Christian Schulte, vous avez &#233;crit :
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Hi Vincent,
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; basically you want to have equivalence (or even equality) reasoning in
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Gecode. Gecode has been explicitly designed to not deal with it. Prior
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; systems (logic programming based systems such as SICStus, Eclipse,
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Mozart, ...) do have equality reasoning (but typically with lots of
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; restrictions
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> if
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; not bugs). However my own experience has been that it is not useful
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; enough (from a general perspective) and the chosen implementation
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; technology (maintaining equivalence classes) is totally ill matched to
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; performing propagation efficiently.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I agree. I don't want to perform a full equality reasoning.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; What would be possible on a general level is to use a substitution based
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; approach. We know how to do it but it is a lot of work.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> That's why I think about a &quot;rewrite&quot; approach where propagators are
</I>&gt;<i> rewritten
</I>&gt;<i> when they detect that two of their variables are the same.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Okay that was just the background info and the answer that there is no
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; general way and just fixing something in Gecode will not do the trick.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Then what you might want to do is to define a new type of variables
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; yourself that just extends Gecode variables by an additional level of
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; indirection to do equivalence reasoning.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I began something like that. I have a new type of variables and propagators
</I>&gt;<i> over these variables.
</I>&gt;<i> When a variable has been found equal to another, I post a &quot;domain equality&quot;
</I>&gt;<i> propagator which ensures that the domains will be always equal. So, normal
</I>&gt;<i> propagators will be  scheduled when domain of one of the two equal
</I>&gt;<i> variables
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> will be updated.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Furthermore, a UNIFY event is emitted. But propagators which are able to
</I>&gt;<i> deal
</I>&gt;<i> with this event have to know which are the equal variables. How to get this
</I>&gt;<i> piece of information from the propagators?
</I>&gt;<i> I think about advisors (with the Delta parameter), but I don't know if it
</I>&gt;<i> is
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> the right choice. I also think about creating an additional field in my new
</I>&gt;<i> variable type, but It will increase the size of the variable (so it will
</I>&gt;<i> lead
</I>&gt;<i> to increase the cloning time).
</I>&gt;<i> I am not sure of how to proceed to get the best efficiency.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Hope that helps
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Yes it helps a lot. Thank you very much.
</I>&gt;<i> Vincent
