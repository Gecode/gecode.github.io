</I>Hi Guido, Mauricio and Raffaele,

Thanks for your replies!

I am not sure what are the trade-offs between the two APIs Guido 
outlined -- is it simply that using reflection will be less flexible?

I am not very familiar with interface generators like SWIG, although I 
did take a look at it briefly several years ago, and my impression was 
that it mainly serve to map the data structures between C/C++ and the 
target language. In ECLiPSe's interface to MP solvers such as CPLEX, we 
needed to do quite a lot of extra coding in C, in addition to the data 
transformation between C and ECLiPSe, and I suspect we might require 
such extra coding for the interface to GeCode as well. In particular, I 
don't expect a direct mapping from ECLiPSe to the GeCode methods at the 
ECLiPSe level.

I expect that at the ECLiPSe level, we will use syntax that looks a lot 
like the existing syntacx for the native solvers. I expect that at a 
minimum, we would need to be able to add both constraints and variables 
dynamically. In the backbox search approach, I think we will also need 
to be able to be able to `backtrack' into the search to obtain further 
solutions after the initially one. In the case where the search is done 
by ECLiPSe, my initial thought is that we need to do only the 
propagation in GeCode, but do the search in ECLiPSe. This would mean 
that we need someway of `undoing' the effects of a propagation step, 
without directly using the search/branching facilities of GeCode. Do you 
expect that I can use Reflection API for both the black-box and the 
ECLiPSe search approach?

I have taken a brief look at the GeList wrapper that Mauricio posted 
about. I think this is not done using an interface generator, and does 
not use the Reflection mechanism. Am I correct?

If I understood Raffaele correctly, his interface generates a GeCode 
script (i.e a C++ program) from the model given in MiniZinc/SICStus,
and this C++ program is then run independently from the host language. I 
don't think this is the approach I am thinking of doing -- Instead we 
want GeCode to be run as part of an ECLiPSe execution.

Thanks and cheers,

Kish
