Subject: [gecode-users] Obtaining information about variablesHi for variable
	selection
Message-ID: <4A4C10C2.2040001@cisco.com>

Hi,

Is it possible to obtain the information used in the branch() variable 
selection. I am currently most interested in the degree (number of 
propagator depending on a variable) for the IntVars, because there I 
can't find any easy way to obtain this information, but I assume Gecode 
keeps this information internally.

The reason I am interested in this information is for the interface to 
Gecode I am developing for ECLiPSe. I now have a basic working version 
where Gecode is used to perform the propagation of the constraints, 
while ECLiPSe does the search, which include variable and value 
selections. I need the degree information for variable selection, and 
because the selection is done in ECLiPSe, I cannot use branch().

Thanks in advance for any help and information!

Cheers,

Kish

Hi,

The degree-information for variables is only available through the
view-interfaces [1]. Similarly for regret-information.

As a simple example, given that you have an IntVar x, and you want to
access the degree-information, you could do the following:
    IntVar x;
    // ...
    Int::IntView xv(x);
    if (xv.degree() > some_degree) {

Cheers,
Mikael

Hi Martin,

we removed the pkgconfig stuff because it had very limited use.  It  
did not work with Windows dlls or Mac OS frameworks.  Even worse, as  
we didn't really use it ourselves, it often was out of sync with the  
actual distribution (e.g. libs missing).
On Linux, all that's necessary to compile and link is putting the  
installation directory on -I and -L paths, and linking the -lgecode...  
libraries.  The Gecode/FlatZinc distribution contains autoconf macros  
that check for Gecode, it's really easy (and if you do it right, it  
works on all platforms).

Cheers,
	Guido

Hi Carlos,

there seem to be several problems in your model.  First, you constrain  
t[0] instead of t[i].  Then, dom(this,t[i],SRT_EQ, i+1, i+3) states  
that t[i] is equal to the set {i+1,...,i+3} - this means that all your  
variables are assigned to fixed sets right from the start.  I guess  
you rather want them to be subsets of {i+1,...,i+3}?  Remember that  
the domain of a set variable is a set of sets, and its value is a  
set.  Third, I guess you mean Sets_Possibles instead of Dia1SetVar.   
If you can't fix the problem now, please send us code that actually  
compiles.

Cheers,
	Guido

Hi Gustavo,

sorry, the tutorial documentation was wrong.  There is no support for  
posting n-ary set operations with arbitrary relations.  You have to  
decompose by hand using an auxiliary variable.  Thanks for pointing  
this out!

Hi,

I want to implement a new constraint, witch is necessary to
model my proper problem, but i didn't understand how to do this, for
example, i try to implement the algorithm of Euclid, i read the
documentation of gecode but it'is very vagueness for me;

if anyone can explain to me how to do this, i will be very thankfull.

amina.

Hi.

The documentation currently only covers modeling, but not implementing  
propagators (that will be added later).  You'll have to look at  
propagators in the Gecode source code and try to adapt them.  However,  
I have to admit I can't really see how to turn Euclid's algorithm into  
a propagator (other than just checking the constraint when the  
variables are assigned, of course).

Cheers,

Hello all,

I can check if two IntViews are ground and equal like this:

  IntView &x = ...
  IntView &y = ...
  if (x.assigned() && y.assigned() && x.val() == y.val())
    ...

Can I do the same thing for sets?  There doesn't seem to be an
equivalent to "val()" in the SetView class.

Thanks,

You'll have to use iterators:

GlbRanges<SetView> xr(x);
GlbRanges<SetView> yr(y);
if (x.assigned() && y.assigned() && Iter::Ranges::equal(xr,yr))
...

If this test is done very often and the sets are usually not equal,  
you can check the cardinalities first in order to speed things up a bit:

if (x.assigned() && y.assigned() && x.cardMin()==y.cardMin() &&  
Iter::Ranges::equal(xr,yr))
...

Hi Kish,

I am just back from holidays. Actually, there is no problem. For an IntVar
x, x.degree() returns the number of subscribed propagators (just checked)!
What was the error you got?

The only thing that's missing is regret_min and regret_max which will be
available for IntVar (and BoolVar) in the next release.

Christian

Hi,

The degree-information for variables is only available through the
view-interfaces [1]. Similarly for regret-information.

As a simple example, given that you have an IntVar x, and you want to
access the degree-information, you could do the following:
    IntVar x;
    // ...
    Int::IntView xv(x);
    if (xv.degree() > some_degree) {

Mikael

Hi,

Sorry, it's me again. I think I know the problem: when you check the members
in the doc you only see the direct members but not the inherited ones. But
there is always a link for showing all members, check here for IntVar:

Hi Kish,

I am just back from holidays. Actually, there is no problem. For an IntVar
x, x.degree() returns the number of subscribed propagators (just checked)!
What was the error you got?

The only thing that's missing is regret_min and regret_max which will be
available for IntVar (and BoolVar) in the next release.

Hi,

The degree-information for variables is only available through the
view-interfaces [1]. Similarly for regret-information.

As a simple example, given that you have an IntVar x, and you want to
access the degree-information, you could do the following:
    IntVar x;
    // ...
    Int::IntView xv(x);
    if (xv.degree() > some_degree) {

Cheers,
Mikael

Subject: [gecode-users] doing multiple minimising searches with the same
	space
Message-ID: <4A650780.2080608@cisco.com>

Hi,

I am now trying to add support for the minimising search engines (BAB, 
Restart) to the ECLiPSe-Gecode interface I am developing.

I think I can see how to implement the cost function, which is only 
given at run-time (with the limitation that the cost is a finite domain 
variable, which has must have a vlaue assigned at the end of labelling 
all the variables specified in the search), *if* the search is done only 
once:

In the Space class I use, I have a IntVarArray (called vInt), 
representing the problem variables. To implement the cost variable, I 
add a Cost IntVar to the space, and when the search routine is called, I 
post an additional constraint

Cost = vInt[i]

where vInt[i] is the problem variable that is defined to be the cost 
variable.

The constrain/cost member function required can then perform the right 
action using the Cost variable.

However, at the ECLiPSe level, I can perform more than one minimising 
search while solving a problem, with different cost variables (and 
persumably with a different set of problem variables). I am not sure how 
I can do this with what I know of Gecode's search engine interface, as I 
have already posted a constraint linking Cost to the vInt[i], cost 
vafriable for the previous search.

Thanks in advance for any help/suggestion for how I can program this!

Cheers,

Kish

Hi Kish,

do I understand you correctly, you want to first minimize one cost  
variable, and then (independently) minimize another?  I.e., when the  
first one is minimized, there's potentially still variables left that  
are not assigned, and then you branch over them, minimizing the  
other?  Or is the actual cost a function of more than one variable  
(say, a weighted sum or something like that)?
If it is the latter, you can (of course) just use a single cost  
variable and post constraints that implement the cost function.
But I assume it is more like the former.  In this case, I'm not sure  
it can be done with the current Gecode search engines.  You'd probably  
have to split the search, first minimizing the first cost, then  
setting up a new problem and minimizing the second variable.
Actually, the new problem might even use the same space (the one  
returned as the optimal solution), as long as you install a new  
branching for the remaining variables and tell the cost method to  
return the new cost variable.

Cheers,
	Guido

Hi Guido,

Thanks for your reply!

I am thinking of the first case. The idea is that you may want to 
subdivide the problem into different set of variables, and perform an 
optimising search on them separately.

If I understood the documentation correctly, the cost/constrain member 
function is part of the space, rather than part of the search (or 
branching), and that I need to define this member function in my code. 
This is why I was thinking of defining a Cost variable as part of the 
space, and at runtime linking this to a specific problem variable -- 
this is to allow me to specify the actual cost function at run-time. I 
expect that the programmer will define the cost function as a constraint 
using the problem variable, say

vInt[i] = vInt[j] + vInt[k]

where i is the problem variable I am using as the cost variable. In the 
above case, the search will probably not branch on i, but will branch on 
j and k (and possibly other variables, of course).

I do expect that the new search will use a new branching, and I expect 
it to use a different cost variable (and cost function). I am not sure I 
see how I could use the same space, since I would have already linked 
the space's cost variable to my previous problem variable, i.e. I would
have posted a constraint like

Cost = vInt[i]

for the previous search. This constraint is no longer valid for the new 
search.

To do the equivalent in the existing ECLiPSe branch-and-bound library 
code, I will call branch-and-bound with a new cost variable, but as the 
cost variable is part of the space, I am not sure how I can do this with 
Gecode. I can of course restrict the problem to have one optimising 
search (during forward execution) only, and most problem will probably 
need more, but it is difficult to explain this restriction.

Cheers,

Kish

Hi Kish,

There is special support for specialized "constrain" functions which just
return a cost variable, you might want to check that in "Modeling with
Gecode". Rather than fixing a particular cost variable you can use a cost
function that then decides which variable to return depending on which cost
variable you want use now. Remember: any problem can be solved with one
additional level of indirection ;-)

Cheers
Christian

Exactly!  You can even use actual assignment instead of an equality  
constraint.  I.e., your space has a member "IntVar cost" that the cost  
function returns.  When you initialize optimization for variable x,  
you execute "space.cost = x" instead of posting the constraint  
"rel(space, cost, IRT_EQ, x)".  That way, you can change that  
assignment later when you start the next search!  You just have to  
make sure that you actually do make such an assignment before you  
start search, and that you update cost (as usual) in the copy  
constructor.

Cheers,
	Guido

Hi Christian and Guido,

Thanks for your replies!

I was looking at the "Modelling with Gecode", or at least an early 
version that Guido sent me. What I wasn't aware of was that you can do a 
simple assignment between two IntVars, as in "space.cost = x". This 
probably reflect my lack of knowledge in C++, but what exactly does such 
an assignment mean?

Thanks and cheers,

Kish

Hi Kish,

That's indeed C++-ish: the meaning of the assignment is defined by the
assignment operator of the left hand side... For an IntView it's quite
simple: it just redirects the left hand side IntView to point to the
variable implementation of the right hand side. Whatever was on the left
hand side will be gone. Almost like in Eclipse provided the left hand side
was a yet unbound and unconstrained var. You might want to check Section 4.1
in MwG.

Is that an answer to your question?

Cheers
Christian

Hi Christian,

Thanks for the quick reply. I think that does answer my question. It is 
like the assignment of a pointer in C.

hello all?
          As a beginner using Gecode, i faced a problem. i want you do me a

         My tools are VS2008, and i can succeed to compile and run  examples

application. But when i develop a MFC application using Gecode, there have
many errors facing to me. Even i simply replanted one example of Gecode ,for
instance TSP, to MFC . Errors as follows:
  "

      I make sure that configures in the properties dialog of my solution

for using Gecode in MFC. I found "The Gecode Interactive Search Tool (Gist)

toolkit<http://trolltech.com/products/qt>."
in the manual of Gecode. Does it have some relations with my trouble?
who know the reason ?
         Thanks for all the people who look at my email.

Hi,



I know that problem: unfortunately the windows headers you include define
the macros min and max (which is a bug in the windows headers). What you
should do is after including the windows headers files, add the following:



#ifdef min

#undef min

#endif



#ifdef max

#undef max

#endif



As you don?t tell us which version of Gecode you use (one should ALWAYS do
that) I can only suggest to have a look at gecode/support/thread.hh in the
latest version of Gecode (3.1.0). There at the very end you?ll find that
fix.



Cheers

Christian

Hi Christian,

Thanks for your reply! I forgot to  tell you that i used Gecode (3.1.0). As
you said, i found the file "gecode/support/thread.hh" and added some lines
in my project files. It can run OK. Thank you for letting me know the
reason. More important is that I will not feel lone in studying with Gecode
, because of helps from the warmhearted people ,like you , even my question
was so simple to some people.

Thanks  again.

Good luck
Kayler

hi,

I try to understand the implementation of the constraint  "distinct", i think that it includes two files :  "distinct.cc" and "distinct.hh", under the folder
gecode/int/, if anyone have an idea, could explain me the base steps of the implementation?

thanks.

Hi,

you might not be aware of the NOMINMAX macro, which can be #defined 
before #including windows.h (maybe a good place to do it is in the 
project settings, or on the compiler command line). This prevents 
windows.h defining the min and max macros.

HTH,
Filip

Hi Filip, 

definitely nope ;-) Thanks for telling, that's useful. Is that commonly known (this is one of the ugliest things I saw in a while...)?

Cheers
Christian

Hi,

you might not be aware of the NOMINMAX macro, which can be #defined 
before #including windows.h (maybe a good place to do it is in the 
project settings, or on the compiler command line). This prevents 
windows.h defining the min and max macros.

HTH,
Filip

Well, Microsoft has an article about this

http://support.microsoft.com/kb/143208

But that does not mean it is not ugly :-) But people use it now and 
then. I wish there was a universal "#define ADHERE_TO_STANDARDS" flag 
instead of this one... or better, if there was no need for one :-)

Cheers,
Filip
