<PRE>Hi Kish,

There is special support for specialized &quot;constrain&quot; functions which just
return a cost variable, you might want to check that in &quot;Modeling with
Gecode&quot;. Rather than fixing a particular cost variable you can use a cost
function that then decides which variable to return depending on which cost
variable you want use now. Remember: any problem can be solved with one
additional level of indirection ;-)

Cheers
Christian

</I>Hi Guido,

Thanks for your reply!

I am thinking of the first case. The idea is that you may want to 
subdivide the problem into different set of variables, and perform an 
optimising search on them separately.

If I understood the documentation correctly, the cost/constrain member 
function is part of the space, rather than part of the search (or 
branching), and that I need to define this member function in my code. 
This is why I was thinking of defining a Cost variable as part of the 
space, and at runtime linking this to a specific problem variable -- 
this is to allow me to specify the actual cost function at run-time. I 
expect that the programmer will define the cost function as a constraint 
using the problem variable, say

vInt[i] = vInt[j] + vInt[k]

where i is the problem variable I am using as the cost variable. In the 
above case, the search will probably not branch on i, but will branch on 
j and k (and possibly other variables, of course).

I do expect that the new search will use a new branching, and I expect 
it to use a different cost variable (and cost function). I am not sure I 
see how I could use the same space, since I would have already linked 
the space's cost variable to my previous problem variable, i.e. I would
have posted a constraint like

Cost = vInt[i]

for the previous search. This constraint is no longer valid for the new 
search.

To do the equivalent in the existing ECLiPSe branch-and-bound library 
code, I will call branch-and-bound with a new cost variable, but as the 
cost variable is part of the space, I am not sure how I can do this with 
Gecode. I can of course restrict the problem to have one optimising 
search (during forward execution) only, and most problem will probably 
need more, but it is difficult to explain this restriction.

Cheers,

Kish
