<PRE>Hi Kish,

That's indeed C++-ish: the meaning of the assignment is defined by the
assignment operator of the left hand side... For an IntView it's quite
simple: it just redirects the left hand side IntView to point to the
variable implementation of the right hand side. Whatever was on the left
hand side will be gone. Almost like in Eclipse provided the left hand side
was a yet unbound and unconstrained var. You might want to check Section 4.1
in MwG.

Is that an answer to your question?

Cheers
Christian

</I>Hi Christian and Guido,

Thanks for your replies!

I was looking at the &quot;Modelling with Gecode&quot;, or at least an early 
version that Guido sent me. What I wasn't aware of was that you can do a 
simple assignment between two IntVars, as in &quot;space.cost = x&quot;. This 
probably reflect my lack of knowledge in C++, but what exactly does such 
an assignment mean?

Thanks and cheers,

Kish
