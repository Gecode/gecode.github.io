Which part of nextDesc do you need exactly? 

Wouldn't next() work for you? and then use top()? And yes, Node should be
public, I'll do that in the trunk.

Subject: [gecode-users] nextDesc in gecode 3.1.0

Hi,

I downloaded Gecode 3.1.0 and I miss a method of 3.0.2. I used the  
nextDesc method of a path to get the next branching, but this method  
disapears in Gecode 3.1.0. Is there a way to get a branching desc or a  
node from a path ?
Should I set the Node nested class to public ?
Thanks for your help.

Cheers,
Vincent

next() + top() (with Node set public) would be perfect.
Thank you Christian :)

Oups, I didn't see that the ds variable is already public in 3.1.
Sorry for my mistake.

Hi Vincent,

What I did in the trunk is to make ds protected again and provide a top()
and empty() method. Does that work for you, or do you need anything else? I
really would like to keep ds protected as we might change to a different
datastructure for ds later.

I attached a patch (or get it from the trunk). Please let me know if there
is anything else you need.

Cheers
Christian

Subject: [gecode-users] flatzinc 1.2.1 question
Message-ID: <63034b790906030220i3175614bjfc94a04580331b03@mail.gmail.com>

Dear all,

I'm trying to use flatzinc-1.2.1 (and gecode-2.1.1) to solve the carseq
problem-instances from the minizinc repository. Working with this
flatzinc/gecode version I quickly get solutions that contains all zeros,
which I think is not correct. On the other hand, i just tried the same
instances using the last version of gecode/flazinc and after 10 minutes I
couldn't get a solution (but this is normal since these instances are quite
difficult, i think I will need a lot of time to get a solution)..

Do you know if there is any bug in Gecode/Flatzinc-1.2.1 (or Minizinc
specification) to have this strange solutions.


Maybe the easiest solution would be to move to gecode-3*, but it is a bit
difficult for me to move to the last gecode version.



Many thanks
Alejandro

Hi,

While I'm not certain how the particular problem you are solving looks
like, there have been several changes to FlatZinc since then. In
particular, the default for arrays is now to start indexing from one
instead of from zero, which obviously makes a lot of models incorrect.

The file CHANGES in the Gecode/FlatZinc distribution contains a list
of the changes for each version.

Cheers,
Mikael

Then, it's really better to always check out the last versions, we can't
really offer support for very old versions (2.1.1 is 15 months old).

Dear all,

here is the edge-finder propagator code with a jobshop example. It is 
the O(n^2) version. Since it is only edge-finder propagator (no 
not-first/not-last yet) and without special branching, it will not solve 
the famous MT10 jobshop. However, it may help you with some smaller 
problems.
Any feedback welcome! I would also appreciate some note if you use it (I 
need it at school to report that my work is useful).

Known bugs: When using debug version of the jobshop example and execute 
it with n threads (for me it was >=3 threads on 2CPU machine), the 
program will occasionally end with assert failure in the parallel search 
code.

Cheers, Jan

Hi,

you have to take a really old version of Gecode, I think pre 2.0.0. After
that the development has been discontinued.

Hi,

Firstly, thanks for the quick reply. I'll have a look to the array indexing.

I agree that the best is to update to the last version, and I do understand
that it is difficult to support old versions. But sometimes it is
complicated to update to new gecode versions, I was doing that from
gecode-2.0.0 to gecode-2.1.1, but my experiments take around 2 weeks (not to
mention the time needed to update my code) and now that the reflection
module is no longer supported, things are even harder for me.



Thanks, I think gecode is a great constraint library.

Alejandro





and now updating is even harder in my case because th

my experiments take 1 or 2 weeks, and i cannot re-run everything for each
new

Message-ID: <CE43C4B4-DBB4-4391-821B-670D4652E42F@labri.fr>

Hello,

I am french, so excuse me if you do not understand me very well.
I am currently working on a research project called VIRAGE (http:// 
www.plateforme-virage.org/), and I use GeCode for constrains solving.

Since last week, I used an old version of GeCode (0.8), and I decided  
to use now the last version (3.1.0) as framework.

I develop under Mac OS 10.4 and using XCode 2.4.
But XCode 2.4 does not allow to use GCC 4.2 ... For using this  
compilator, I need to download XCode 3.1.2, only working under Mac OS  
10.5.

I would like to know if there is a solution to use Gecode Framework  
with GCC 4.0 or if somebody know how to compile using GCC 4.2 under  
XCode 2.4 ?

Thank you very much
Best regards
Raphael

Hi,

the Gecode guy knowing Mac (Guido) is currently on holidays. I think he'll
be back end of this month.

Sorry but I know zip about Mac. Maybe somebody else?

As far as I know XCode is really tight to gcc and even worse, to apple  
gcc. What you can do  is to download unofficial versions of gcc 4.2  
(gnu-gcc) that you can install on Mac Os tiger (see http://r.research.att.com/tools/ 
  ). But using them from Xcode is not possible. In my opinion, this  
give you at least the possibility to use recent versions of gecode on  
Tiger. If you follow this way remember that this compiler will not  
produce or deal with MacOS framworks, just with dynamic libraries.


Hope this helps,

Gustavo

If the problem is that you use gecode for the constraint stuff and  
other people in your work group use xcode for the gui development then  
you can provide them with a library with your implementation (all the  
constraint part). The library you provide is independent from the  
compiler you used to produce it so you can import it from whatever   
Xcode project you want.

Hmmm, I had a quick look. Maybe it's again an issue with doxygen (I couldn't
see a quirk in the file). I'll look some more later.

Shall we fix it for 3.1.0 or can we wait for the next release?

Subject: [gecode-users] problem using IntVarArgs
Message-ID: <4A3129DD.1040301@cisco.com>

Hi,

I am running into a seg fault with posting simple constraints with a 
IntVarArgs. I am using GeCode 3.0.2.

What I want to do is to set a variable in IntVarArgs to a value. I tird 
the following two ways:

dom(*solver, alldiff[i], i)

and
rel(*solver, alldiff[i], IRT_EQ, i)

where alldiff is a IntVarArgs

Both seem to cause a seg fault.

I haven't used Gecode much, so I assume I am making some basic mistake 
-- can someone please let me know what I am doing wrong?

[For the context of what I am doing, I am trying to implement the 
distinct constraint, which takes a IntVarArgs. However, some of these 
variables may already be set to an integer value -- this is what I am 
trying to do here -- the distinct constraint have not been posted at 
this point]

Thanks in advance for any help!

Kish

Hi Kish,

Let me venture a guess: you did not initialize the arguments of IntVarArgs.
When you create an IntVarArgs object, its fields are uninitialized. So what
you might want do is

IntVarArgs x(n);
for (int i=0; i<n; i++)
   x[i].init(home, ..., ...);

Where ... are smallest and largest possible value.

Is that it?

Cheers
Christian

Hi Christian,

Thanks. You are correct, I did not initialise the variables, because in 
the normal case they will be set to other IntVar that is already part of 
the space.

In this case, I assume I should just use x[i].init() to set x[i]'s min 
and max to the same integer value,
x[i].init(home, v, v)

and then I don't need to post the dom or rel constraint at all, right?

Cheers,

Kish

Yep, that'll do the trick and no need to post dom or rel.

Hi Christian,

Thanks. You are correct, I did not initialise the variables, because in 
the normal case they will be set to other IntVar that is already part of 
the space.

In this case, I assume I should just use x[i].init() to set x[i]'s min 
and max to the same integer value,
x[i].init(home, v, v)

and then I don't need to post the dom or rel constraint at all, right?

Cheers,

Kish

To start, sorry if I am saying something stupid :). 

Translating the large domain to a smaller one is a good idea, the
problem is that besides I need to use the extensional constraint to make
sure that the values belong to some matrix, I also have to apply
constraints to some of the values individual values of the tuple, based
on the values of the large domain. So, if I translate the domain to a
smaller one, then I have no way to apply such constraints.

For instance, let's suppose I have the following matrix:

matrix={{9900, 1234, 2349} 
        {9901, 2345, 5678}}

wich will be translated to:

translated_matrix={{0,1,2,3}
	           {4,5,6,7}}

Then I will apply an extensional constraint to make sure that the
variables C={X1,X2,X3} and C1={Y1,Y2,Y3} belongs to translated_matrix.

Then I need to apply constraints that relate individual values on each
of the tuple, such as

Y1 - X1 < 10

The problem is that this last constraint should be applied over the
initial values, and with the translated domain I can not apply such
constraints because I don't have the original values...


About the element constraint, I didn't got that one. For what I
understood on the documentation, it just constraints one variable to an
element of an array. How do this fit this problem? 

Thank you, 
Pedro Salgueiro

use extensional on the translated domains

yes you do: apply the constraint on de-translated versions of the vars

let's say:

translated_matrix={{0,1,2}
 	           {3,4,5}}

so that the number of values actually correspond ;-)

you use extensional on the translated matrix.

I write A=<B1,B2,...,Bn>[I] for the element constraint.
Constrain 2 new variables XX1 and YY1 as follows:

XX1 = <9900,1234,2349,9901,2345,5678>[X1]
YY1 = <9900,1234,2349,9901,2345,5678>[Y1]

XX1 and YY1 are the de-translated versions of X1 and Y1, and you can
pose the constraint:

YY1 - XX1 < 10

> About the element constraint, I didn't got that one.

I hope the above example clears it up for you.

Hello

Thank you very much both of you for your fast answers.
The engines of VIRAGE I develop is developped under Eclipse, and with  
unofficial versions of gcc 4.2, it works perfectly.
Thank you very much !

But the GUI of VIRAGE is developed by another person under XCode, and  
it includes all the engines source files.
If I update GeCode in the project, the GUI will not compile under XCode.

So there is the dilemma.

And I am really disappointed by XCode.

Thank again
Best regards
Raphael

Hmmm, I tried everything but the problem remains. And it is a bug in Doxygen (and the webpages say that this is known). So nothing we can do, really.

Thanks for the report anyway!

Yes, there's GECODE_HAS_GIST (defined in gecode/support/config.hpp).

You seem to be using an old version of Gecode, this particular problem
(that it was too complicated to compile the examples independently)
was addressed in the 3.1.0 release.

Cheers,
Mikael

Yes, I can: read Modeling with Gecode to find out how to compile and execute
programs! The first three chapters will do. But I said that before, right?

i'm using gecode 3.1.0 with cygwin, i have done the first step of installation: "compiling and installing gecode" but the second one i haven't understand how we fix it: "compiling and linking against gecode"

 

 i read in gecode doc and i think it'a about library names. i hope that you understand my problem

Well, you installed MSVC and then you try to compile with gcc?  Now, this is
the last tip I am willing to give in this matter. Follow the example EXACTLY
from Modeling with Gecode after CAREFUL reading. Try it until you can
compile as described there. If you can?t pull that off, Gecode might not be
something for you.

WHERE do you run it? Under cygwin, then that?s wrong (replace %GECODEDIR% by
$GECODEDIR). The document says WHERE to run it. Please, please, please,
read!

Subject: [gecode-users] 3.1.0 : pkgconfig information missing
Message-ID: <4A43AA59.70906@informatik.uni-freiburg.de>

Hi,

I just encountered that in the current version (3.1.0) the pkgconfig 
information is not installed into the "lib"-folder anymore. At least in 
my setup when building only static and no shared libraries.

After running "make install" only the libraries are placed in the final 
folder but "pkgconfig" subfolder with the additional library information 
is created.

Please have a look if this is really a bug within the configure (was 
working for 3.0.2). If not I can send further information on my build-setup.

Thanks,

Martin

I've seen you removed the pkgconfig stuff more or less completely from 
the 3.1.0 version..

Any reason for that? I found it useful to check for the library version 
etc. via pkgconfig and was able to do an easy configure based compiler 
and linker flag setup.

Just to let you know: at least one user was happy about the pkgconfig 
information. ;)

So long,

Martin

hi martin,

 

i ask you if you could help me, i'm a begginer in gecode programming, i have i big problem i can't compil and linking gainst gecode, i can't compil gecode examples like magic-square after i modified some param?ters of them, i install gecode 3.1.0 
and visual studio and cygwin all succesfully. thanks in advance

Martin, you have to haggle with Guido on that. He sits currently on a plane
bringing him back from down under... So, you'll need to be patient...

I offer excuses for the wrong message, this is the correct message:
I am trying to use Gecode for  solve this  problem:
I have two SetVar  and each one  must  satisfy  the constraints:
1.To have a domain in an interval defined   between your position in the
SetVarArray and  your position + n , for example , if  n=3:
  dom(setvar1)= {1..4}
  dom(setvar2)={2..5}
2.The domain of each variable must be  Subset  of other SetVar called
Sets_Possibles.

I believe that this model:
class model : public model {
        public:
                SetVarArray t;
                SetVar Sets_Possibles;
                void explore(Space* root, Gist::Inspector* i){
                        (void ) Gecode::explore(root,i);
                }

                model():t(this,2,IntSet::empty, IntSet(1,10),4,4),
Sets_Possibles(this,IntSet::empty,1,6,4,4)
                {
                        for(int i=0; i < 2; i++){
                                dom(this,t[0],SRT_EQ, i+1, i+3);
                                rel(this,t[0], SRT_SUB,Dia1SetVar);
                        }
                        branch(this, t, Gecode::SET_VAR_NONE,  SET_VAL_MAX);
                }

                model(bool share, model& m) : Space(share,m) {
                    t.update(this, share, m.t);
                    Sets_Possibles.update(this, share, m.Sets_Possibles);
                }
        ....


Should throw the solutions t[0]= {1..4} t[1]= {2..5}, but I do not obtain
any solution,so, someone can help me with an idea  about why it does not
work.
Thanks for your great patience and any colaboration.

/*Hello guys, I am trying to use Gecode por solve this simple problem:
 * I have two SetVar  and cada una debe cumplr las restriccioens:
 * 1. debe tener un  dominio en un intervalo  definido entre su posision  y
su posicion + n ,
 *  .Por example ,si n=3
 *       dom(setvar1)= {1..4}
 *       dom(setvar2)={2..5}
 * 2.el dominio  de cada variable debe ser Subset  de  otra variable de
conjuntos Sets_Possibles

I think this   model must function:
class model : public model {
        public:
                SetVarArray t;//
                SetVar Sets_Possibles;

                //Sets_Possibles  : keeps between others , the sets:
{1,2,3,4} {2,3,4,5} {3,4,5,6}
                model():t(this,2,IntSet::empty, IntSet(1,10),4,4),
Sets_Possibles(this,IntSet::empty,1,6,4,4)
                {
                        for(int i=0; i < 2; i++){//for each SetVar in t
                                dom(this,t[0],SRT_EQ, i+1, i+3);
                                rel(this,t[0], SRT_SUB, Sets_Possibles);
                        }
                        branch(this, t, Gecode::SET_VAR_NONE,  SET_VAL_MAX);
                }

                model(bool share, model& m) : Space(share,m) {
                        Sets_Possibles.update(this, share,
m.Sets_Possibles);
                }






, i wait the solutions:
 setvar1= {1,2,3,4}
 setvar2= {2,3,4,5}
 but this don't found solutions , so, can something ayudarme a entender  why
this model don't function, cualquier idea es bienvenida,gracias.

hi every one,

 

i tring to implement a simple algorithme of matching graph, i've done the data structure (i represent the graphes by an adjacency list: i've an array of nodes). my algorithme consist de verify for each node of G1 if there are any nodes in G2 such these two nodes have the same degree.

 

i've two questions:

1-how can i represent this by a constraint in gecode.

2-also i ask if someone had some details about cp graph, i saw this http://cpgraph.info.ucl.ac.be/cpgraph/doc/group__Examples.html but it's not very claer. thank you

Hello Hamza,
That cpgraph code has not been updated for a long time. You'd be  
better off not bothering with it.
If you want to check out newer code you can have a chat with David   
Przybilla.
For the topic of graph matching you could have a look at Stephane  
Zampelli's thesis from Louvain.
Best,

hi every one,
 
i had post yesterday an e-mail and i got tworelevant answers, i just want to know if there any others idea :
 
like i said before a begginer in programming constraint in gecode, i want to implement an algorithme to detect an isomorphsim in graphs,
 
my algorithme is too simple i work with nodes degrees so if two nodes had the same degree they can be match, i have done the data structure ( isue an adjacency list to representing the graphs)
 
i'm blocking on converting this description to gecode constraint, so if you have any idea or a basic a example i thank you in advance.

Hi everyone, I'm searching for a small example to solving this constraint
2 sets of integer elements (redandance is accepted), verify if the elements of set 1 are present in set 2 and also if they have the same cardinality
Can you help me, I'll use it as starting point.

Subject: [gecode-users] seg fault with posting dom constraint
Message-ID: <4A490BD0.6060501@cisco.com>

Hi,

I am running into a seg fault with using the dom constraint.
I am testing the ECLiPSe interface to Gecode with the following ECLiPSe 
code:
     A :: [1..3], A :: [1..2].

Basically, this first set the integer variable (A) with the domain 
interval from 1 to 3, and then constrain the variable with a new 
interval 1 to 2. The seg fault seems to happen with this second call.

The calls to Gecode is done at runtime via the interface code I have 
written, so there is no C++ program, but I have traced the calls via 
gdb, and the following calls to Gecode are done:

setting the initial domain to 1..3:
(GecodeSpace is derived from Space with a IntVarArray vInt)

solver = new GecodeSpace();

solver->vInt.reize(*solver, 1);
solver->vInt[0].init(*solver, 1, 3);

constraining the domain to 1..2

size = 1;
IntVarArgs vars(size);
vars[0] = solver->vInt[0];

dom(*solver, vars, 1, 2);

The seg fault seems to happen in this call to dom(). gdb reports that 
the seg fault happens in int/var-imp/int.hpp:349,

which in my version of gecode is:
   forceinline ModEvent
   IntVarImp::gq(Space& home, int n) {
     if (n <= dom.min()) return ME_INT_NONE;  <--- here

(Sorry I had to type the above by hand -- don't seem to be able to cut 
and paste between a VNC window and my mailer running on the host Windows 
XP).

[As far as I know, I did not compile gecode to be debuggable, but gdb 
nevertheless seem to trace some C++ execution, but I am not sure how 
accurate the indication that the seg fault is in line 349 is]

I am using Gecode 3.0.2, g++ 4.2.1 running on 32 bit x86 Linux.

Am I doing something obviously wrong?

Thanks in advance for any help!

I should have looked at the problem more before posting. It seems that 
the problem is in the way I assign the IntVarArg:

> vars[0] = solver->vInt[0];

which is actually done via a call to a procedure, something like:

int assign(GecodeSpace* solver, IntVarArgs vars) {
	vars[0] = solver->vInt[0];
}
...
IntVarArgs vars[1];
assign(solver, vars);

dom(*solver, vars);

I assume I cannot pass IntVarArgs vars in the way I am doing -- this is 
probably due to my C background, I had assumed that IntVarArgs is an 
array, I can just pass it and any changes to its elements will be seen 
in the parent, but I guess this is not correct?

H,

You are indeed right that passing vars as you are doing will not allow
changing the the argument so that it is visible outside of assign. To
send the argument so that changes are visible outside you should use a
reference:
  int assign(GecodeSpace* solver, IntVarArgs& vars) {
         vars[0] = solver->vInt[0];
  }

As for debug information, an optimized build will include
debug-information, but due to inlining it will very often not be very
accurate. It is good enough to give some indication as to where the
problem lies, but not much more.

Cheers,
Mikael

Hello,

In the document "Modeling with Gecode", section 5.2.3 "Set operations"  
you say that:

rel(home, SOT_UNION, x, SRT_SUP, y);

Enforces a union relation of all the elements of x (an array of set  
variables) to be a subset of set variable y. When I tried to use this  
constraint I got an error from the compiler saying that such a  
function does not exist:

  error: no matching function for call to 'rel(GdPIPSolver&,  
Gecode::SetOpType, Gecode::SetVarArray&, Gecode::SetRelType,  
Gecode::SetVar&)'

The line in my code producing the error is:

rel(*this,SOT_UNION,supliers,SRT_SUB,nT);

being suppliers the array of set variables and nT a set variable.

When I open the documentation (the part linked from the first  
paragraph of the section 5.2.3) I notice that the only methods that  
take a SetOpType as a second parameter are:

void 	Gecode::rel (Space &home, SetOpType op, const SetVarArgs &x,  
SetVar y)
  	Post propagator for $ y = \diamond_{\mathit{op}} x$.
void 	Gecode::rel (Space &home, SetOpType op, const SetVarArgs &x,  
const IntSet &z, SetVar y)
  	Post propagator for $ y = \diamond_{\mathit{op}} x  
\diamond_{\mathit{op}} z$.

Which of course do not match with the documented function. Am I  
missing something?, probably I am looking at the wrong place an is an  
stupid mistake.


Regards,
Gustavo

You are quite right that the functions do not exist, this should be
fixed in the documentation.

To get the same effect, you could use a decomposition with a temporary
set variable:
    {
        SetVar tmp(*this, glb, lub);
        rel(*this,SOT_UNION,supliers,SRT_SUB,tmp);
        rel(*this, tmp, SRT_SUB, nT);
    }
for some appropriate glb and lub.

Cheers,
Mikael
