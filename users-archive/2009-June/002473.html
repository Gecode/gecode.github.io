<PRE>Hi!

I have been busy on something else, and just now got back to this.

To start, sorry if I am saying something stupid :). 

Translating the large domain to a smaller one is a good idea, the
problem is that besides I need to use the extensional constraint to make
sure that the values belong to some matrix, I also have to apply
constraints to some of the values individual values of the tuple, based
on the values of the large domain. So, if I translate the domain to a
smaller one, then I have no way to apply such constraints.

For instance, let's suppose I have the following matrix:

matrix={{9900, 1234, 2349} 
        {9901, 2345, 5678}}

wich will be translated to:

translated_matrix={{0,1,2,3}
	           {4,5,6,7}}

Then I will apply an extensional constraint to make sure that the
variables C={X1,X2,X3} and C1={Y1,Y2,Y3} belongs to translated_matrix.

Then I need to apply constraints that relate individual values on each
of the tuple, such as

Y1 - X1 &lt; 10

The problem is that this last constraint should be applied over the
initial values, and with the translated domain I can not apply such
constraints because I don't have the original values...


About the element constraint, I didn't got that one. For what I
understood on the documentation, it just constraints one variable to an
element of an array. How do this fit this problem? 

Thank you, 
Pedro Salgueiro
