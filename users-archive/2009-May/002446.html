<PRE>Right now, you can't stop branching. While just having an operation to do
that is easy, but I do not see yet how one would get that to work with
recomputation.

Did you see that you can actually post branching incrementally, maybe that
could help. Check &quot;Executing code between branching&quot; in MwG. You could
control whether a branching is posted or not by an additional variable. Just
an idea, don't know whether that would help.

Subject: [gecode-users] How to stop a branching?

Hi,

I would like to know, if it is possible to stop a branching (when 
multiple ones are present). Thus, to ignore all remaining branches for 
this specific one.

Maybe an example to make my question clear.

I have two sets of variables X_1, X_2 linked via several constraints. 
Within my Space I post two brachning B_1(X_1) and B_2(X_2) such that 
first all variables of X_1 are assigned before B_2 is considered.

My final goal is to enumerate solutions with different X_1 assignments!

My current solution (was implemented for Gecode 1.3.* and I am going to 
reimplement in 3.*) is to formulate a COP instead of a CSP and to 
implement the *constrain* function and to post a constraint that ensures 
that the next solution is at least in one X_1 assignment different from 
the current solution.

Thus, I get a new constraint per solution ... and I dont like that! ;)

But when looking at the problem, it would be sufficient to stop the 
branching on X_2! I dont need to post new constraints but to cancel the 
remaining branching of B_2 on X_2. This will lead to a backtracking in 
B_1 and therefore ensures that the next solution differs in the X_1 
assignment in at least one solution...

This seems to be much more efficient to me. Btw. I would end up with a 
CSP instead of this strange COP hack.

So my question: Is it possible to stop the remaining branching on B_2 
out of the (Gecode 3.*) box? Or do I have to implement/subclass my own 
branching?

Thanks for your help,

Martin
