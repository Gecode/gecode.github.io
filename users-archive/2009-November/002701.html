DOCTORAL AND POSTDOCTORAL RESEARCH POSITIONS IN CONSTRAINT PROGRAMMING

   Declarative Languages and Artificial Intelligence Group
   Department of Computer Science
   Catholic University of Leuven, Belgium

The Declarative Languages and Artificial Intelligence Group at the
Catholic University of Leuven is urgently looking for doctoral and
postdoctoral research candidates in the area of Constraint Programming.

Both positions concern the application and development of Constraint
Programming techniques, and the Monadic Constraint Programming framework in
particular, for solving problems of industrial scale. Close collaboration
with
our industrial partners is expected, and involves aspects of mutual
interest,
modeling, search heuristics and parallelization among others. More
information on the Monadic Constraint Programming can be found at
<A HREF="http://www.cs.kuleuven.be/~toms/MCP/.">http://www.cs.kuleuven.be/~toms/MCP/.</A>

For the postdoctoral position, applicants should have a Ph.D. in Computer
Science and for the doctoral position, a masters degree in Computer Science
or
equivalent. A background and interest in Constraint Programming is
essential.
Experience in functional programming (Haskell), Gecode, software engineering
and implementation are important assets.

Appointment to the postdoctoral position will be for the period of up to two
years.  Appointment to the doctoral position will be for the period of one
year
initially with possibility for extension to four years ending in a Ph.D.
The
salary is compatible with the departmental rates for postdoctoral and
doctoral
research fellows, and can take experience into consideration.

Please direct inquiries and applications, preferably by e-mail, to:

    Professor Bart Demoen
    Department of Computer Science
    K.U.Leuven
    Celestijnenlaan 200A
    B-3001 Heverlee
    Belgium

    Email: <A HREF="https://www.ps.uni-sb.de/mailman/listinfo/users">bart.demoen at cs.kuleuven.be</A>
    Phone: +32 16 327547

Informal notice of interest should be received as soon as possible no later 
than
November 25, 2009. Review of applications begins as of now.  Positions start
as
soon as January 1, 2010.
