<PRE>Good morning,

Thank you both for your replies.
&gt;<i> Another hint: if your model uses the standard Gecode search engines, you can
</I>&gt;<i> inquire how much memory is occupied by the nodes of the search tree. If
</I>&gt;<i> there is a huge difference between what is reported by the search engine and
</I>&gt;<i> what is reported by your operating system, you program just has a memory
</I>&gt;<i> leak.
</I>&gt;<i>   
</I>I indeed use a standard Gecode search engine (Branch-and-Bound). I 
followed you advice and performed the test: both values are coherent.
&gt;<i> Then, how deep is the search tree? How many variables and propagators does
</I>&gt;<i> your problem have?
</I>&gt;<i>   
</I>Here are the figures:
- Variables: 622
- Propagators: 25654
- Deep: 49

&gt;<i> In the end: we could say much more if you provided a little bit more detail
</I>&gt;<i> about what you observe. The information that your program uses a lot of
</I>&gt;<i> memory is not that helpful in itself.
</I>&gt;<i>   
</I>Mea culpa: the memory consumption reaches 862MB.

My message was inaccurate yesterday evening: the memory peak occurs when 
the engine constructor is called. It's maybe consistent with the figures 
provided above ?

Beno&#238;t
