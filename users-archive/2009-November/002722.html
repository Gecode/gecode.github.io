<PRE>Hi,

I don't really know what could be the reason without further looking at the
program. The memory consumed looks massive, actually, almost impossible.

Let's do some math: the search tree has a depth of 45, say with
recomputation possibly using adaptive recomputation that might be around 10
spaces stored during search. That is, each space takes almost 100 Meg! A
thousand variables and 30000 propagators (which propagators do you use?)
should normally take much less.

So, looks really fishy.

Christian

Subject: [gecode-users] High memory consumption during engine declaration

Good morning,

Thank you both for your replies.
&gt;<i> Another hint: if your model uses the standard Gecode search engines, you
</I>can
&gt;<i> inquire how much memory is occupied by the nodes of the search tree. If
</I>&gt;<i> there is a huge difference between what is reported by the search engine
</I>and
&gt;<i> what is reported by your operating system, you program just has a memory
</I>&gt;<i> leak.
</I>&gt;<i>   
</I>I indeed use a standard Gecode search engine (Branch-and-Bound). I 
followed you advice and performed the test: both values are coherent.
&gt;<i> Then, how deep is the search tree? How many variables and propagators does
</I>&gt;<i> your problem have?
</I>&gt;<i>   
</I>Here are the figures:
- Variables: 622
- Propagators: 25654
- Deep: 49

&gt;<i> In the end: we could say much more if you provided a little bit more
</I>detail
&gt;<i> about what you observe. The information that your program uses a lot of
</I>&gt;<i> memory is not that helpful in itself.
</I>&gt;<i>   
</I>Mea culpa: the memory consumption reaches 862MB.

My message was inaccurate yesterday evening: the memory peak occurs when 
the engine constructor is called. It's maybe consistent with the figures 
provided above ?

Beno&#238;t
