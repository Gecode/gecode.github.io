<PRE>After some more reading of the DFS and LDS code I think I've got it  
more or less worked out. It doesn't need to be terribly efficient. It  
is the 'conventional approach' in an experiment which aims to show  
that another approach is superior, so I'm not going out of my way to  
optimise it cleverly.

It could, however, be worth implementing an RCS-style system in  
general. The value would depend on how good your heuristic is. A good  
heuristic should result in behaviour very similar to DFS. A bad  
heuristic could cause search to behave more like BFS which would make  
RCS fairly useless, I think.

</I>&gt;<i> space, you follow the parent pointers up in the tree to find a node  
</I>&gt;<i> with a space, and recompute the target node.
</I>&gt;<i> I'm not quite sure how this works in practice, as you'll have to  
</I>&gt;<i> actually create a space for each node when you create it, to  
</I>&gt;<i> determine its priority.  I guess you'd then throw away the spaces  
</I>&gt;<i> for all nodes except the best, or something similar.
