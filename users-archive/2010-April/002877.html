<PRE>This does seem to be just a gist issue. I guess looking at that was throwing me off. I used the MinimizeScript and it seems to behave as described as far as cloning. I suppose our issue is just the number of propagators and the size of the domains. I suppose we will have to look into defining our own propagators. Do you have any recommendations for what to aim for in defining our own propagators to reduce the memory usage and get the most bang for our buck. What actually consumes the memory, common pitfalls, optimization tricks?

As an example, We are doing things to constrain tasks that are somewhat complicated such as you can only have 3 tasks or 10 hours worth of usage in a period of time and these periods repeat over a specified interval.

That was actually a small bug in Gist that only occurred when using interactive search.  I just fixed it in the trunk version.

Cheers,

</I>&gt;<i> Hi Ashis,
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> would you mind posting your message to the mailing list?  I think this might
</I>&gt;<i> interest others, too.  Anyway, here's my answer.

</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Yes, that was also my understanding in terms of setting c_d and a_d. I was

</I>&gt;<i> it can use less memory and not run out of memory. But one thing you made
</I>&gt;<i> clear is that even if I do not set a_d it will default to 2. I probably
</I>&gt;<i> missed seeing that in documentation. I was hoping the default behavior of
</I>&gt;<i> a_d will be like setting it higher than c_d (that is a_d is not used).
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> The defaults are independent of each other (i.e. c_d is always 8 and a_d is
</I>&gt;<i> always 2).  We tried to come up with something more automatic, but it's not
</I>&gt;<i> clear how that's supposed to work.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> In any event, yes my problem runs out of memory with default c_d and a_d.
</I>&gt;<i> And it does run out with other combination of c_d and a_d as well (say c_d =
</I>&gt;<i> 20000 and a_d = 10000 or c_d = 200 and a_d = 100). Strange thing is even
</I>&gt;<i> with varied c_d &amp; a_d combination, my memory consumption graph rises almost
</I>&gt;<i> similar way (as observed from Windows Task Manager). To give you some
</I>&gt;<i> background, I am working on Scheduler problems that contain hundreds of
</I>&gt;<i> tasks with large start domains and have many choices on resource. Previously
</I>&gt;<i> I was using Mozart/Oz, but recently transferred my code to Gecode hoping it
</I>&gt;<i> will help my memory problem. It appeared to do so when it ran a problem with
</I>&gt;<i> 600 tasks rather quickly. But when I try to run a problem with 1000 tasks,
</I>&gt;<i> it crashes within a couple of minutes saying &quot;heap memory is exhausted&quot;. It
</I>&gt;<i> may be that my memory problem is exhausting before it comes to choices and
</I>&gt;<i> that's why c_d and a_d value are not making much of a difference! Can you
</I>&gt;<i> please comment o
</I>&gt;<i> n!
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> this?
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> You could try running your problem in Gist and double-click the root node
</I>&gt;<i> (that will create exactly one instance of your problem and not perform any
</I>&gt;<i> search).
</I>&gt;<i> If that exhausts the memory, it's clearly a problem in the model itself.
</I>&gt;<i> Actually, if that doesn't exhaust the memory, then setting c_d/a_d very high
</I>&gt;<i> should definitely at least change the memory behavior, because with a very
</I>&gt;<i> high c_d/a_d, the required memory is pretty much exactly twice the memory of
</I>&gt;<i> the root node.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> If it turns out to be a problem in the root node already, there's several
</I>&gt;<i> things one could try.  First of all, you should check how many variables you
</I>&gt;<i> create.  If it's quadratic in the problem size (e.g. one Boolean for every
</I>&gt;<i> pair of tasks could be typical for scheduling problems), that would explain
</I>&gt;<i> the difference between 600 and 1000 tasks - I'm also working on scheduling
</I>&gt;<i> problems right now and I've run into similar issues.  Being very careful not
</I>&gt;<i> to create too many temporary variables is very important in this case.
</I>&gt;<i> Then, it's sometimes possible to replace a set of propagators with one
</I>&gt;<i> custom propagator.  That can help a lot if there's a large number (say,
</I>&gt;<i> quadratically many) of these propagators.
</I>&gt;<i> Finally, reformulating the problem might help, or trying to solve a
</I>&gt;<i> relaxation (e.g. aggregating several tasks into bigger meta-tasks to make
</I>&gt;<i> the problem smaller), but that's of course very problem-specific and
</I>&gt;<i> sometimes simply impossible.
