<PRE>Hi,

I just tried to compile my existing code (working with gecode 3.0.2) 
with gecode 3.4.0, and I was somewhat surprised by a lot of errors,
which seems to indicate that there are major changes in the API.

I know that significant functionality have been added in 3.4, but I had 
sort of expected that the old API will still be supported, and I don't 
remember any mention of API incompatibility. It looks like even some 
rather simple things (which I would not expect to change), like the init 
method for IntVar, is not in 3.4's API.

Am I doing something wrong, or has the API really changed significantly?

Cheers,

Kish
