<PRE>Hi Kish,

I implemented the algorithm and it is the simple reason you mention. Perhaps we can port the Eclipse version into Gecode?

Subject: 	[gecode-users] algorithm used in sequence constraint

Hi,

In the MPG, it is stated that the sequence constraint is implemented 
using the domain consistent algorithm described in the paper by van 
Hoeve and others.

Last year, Helmut Simonis contributed the sequence constraint for 
ECLiPSe, and he used the (also domain consistent) algorithm described in 
the paper by Maher and others in CP 2008. As fat as I can tell from 
checking the two papers, Maher's algorithm was developed after the one 
proposed by van Hoeve, and may be more efficient.

Was the reason for implementing van Hoeve's algorithm in gecode simply 
because it was made before Maher's was published, or is there some other 
reason for picking it?

Thanks and cheers,

Kish
