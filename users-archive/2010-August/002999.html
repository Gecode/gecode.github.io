Hi David,

I should say first that I am not very familiar with the implementation 
of sequence done by Helmut.

It probably doesn't make too much sense to port the ECLiPSe code -- it 
is written entirely in ECLiPSe (i.e. basically Prolog), and the code has 
to work round the restriction of no multiple edges between two nodes in 
the maximum flow code used.

However, I suspect a lot of the infra-structure needed is already in 
gecode -- I assume there is already some implementation of the maximum 
flow algorithm, needed for implementing other constraints, such as 
global cardinality.

Cheers,

Kish
