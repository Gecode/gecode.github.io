Hi all,

I am working on an optimization problem defined using constraints,
to compute the lowest energy model of a protein lattice. My variables are
implemented as integer variables that refer to a pool of protein fragments,
and I wish to implement an optimization function that - given an assignment
of all variables - returns an energy value (double) that should be minimized.

So far, I've implemented the optimization as follows:

- in the model constructor, I use synchronized execution to call a function
c when all variables become assigned (using wait(Space&, IntVarArray&, c&)

- a static variable that holds the best energy so far

static BEST_ENERGY = 10000;

- the continuation function c looks something like 

static void c(Space& _home) {
	// compute energy using assigned variables
	double energy = ...;

	if(energy > BEST_ENERGY) {
 		// fail if energy is worse
		home.fail();
	} else {
		BEST_ENERGY = energy;
	}
}


This works fine, and I can use different search algorithms to traverse the tree
and move into the direction of lowest energy. However, I am not sure if this is the 
correct way. Initially, I thought about implementing the cost() function but quickly
discarded it because it only seems to work with integer variables. Also using the
constrain function I need to use a static variable as well, and I don't know what
kind of constrained I should post there (the energy function can not prune domains,
it can either accept it as better or fail the space..)

Thanks for the clarification!
Peter

Hi,

The problem with your solution is that you do not use branch and bound for
search (as you basically say yourself): what you will do is basically find
all solutions and pick a best one among them (provided I really understand
what you are doing). The idea of branch and bound is to add a constraint
after a solution has been found such that the additional constraint will
guarantee that a better solution is found next and - crucially! - the added
constraint can prune the search space by triggering additional propagation.

Moreover, your idea is not compatible with parallel search (static
variable).

Did you think about turning your double value into a sufficiently accurate
integer variable?

Thanks for the answer. Conceptually, I see a problem in the energy constraint:
it can only work if all variables are instantiated. Would it make sense to write
a function that posts the energy constraint? Something like

void energy(Home home, const IntVarArgs& x, double n, IntConLevel icl=ICL_DEF);

that would then implement a propagator that will get called once all variables
are instantiated, checks if the energy is better than n, and if not, fails the space.

I could then probably call this constraint within the constrain() function and bypass
use of static variables. Still, it wouldn't change the search tree, but this is
simply because the energy constraint is unable the domains. Is this correct
reasoning? The static variable seemed much easier to implement than implementing
a post function.

I hadn't given it a thought to convert the double to an int, but would this make
sense if there is nothing to prune?

Thanks a lot,
Peter

Hi all,

I am using the Qt-SDK (including Qt-creator 1.3.1) along with Gecode 3.2.2 under ubuntu linux, and it works fine.
I installed the same environment (Gecode 3.2.2 + Qt-creator 1.3.1 + Qt libraries 4.6.1 + MinGW with gcc-4.4) on a windows XP, unfortunately I cannot get it to work. More precisely I cannot compile my Gecode-based program from Qt-creator. It seems qmake does not find Gecode libraries (I updated the PATH to include Gecode's location). The compilation returns errors such as "gecode/int.hh no such file or directory" or "Gecode has not been declared".

I had a look at the following page:
http://www.gecode.org/doc-latest/reference/PageUsage.html
but I do not manage to adapt the recommandations for Visual Studio to Qt-creator.

Did anyone suceed in using Qt-creator with Gecode under XP ?

Thanks,

Yannick

Hi Yannick,

as mentioned recently on the list, we don't support compiling with gcc on Windows.  In particular, the Gecode binary package is probably incompatible with MinGW gcc, so even if you get the paths right, compiling may not work.
If you can get Qt-creator to use the Visual C++ compiler (which however the binary package on the Qt web page doesn't support), things might work.

Cheers,
	Guido

Hi Peter,

Hmm. Why are you so sure that the energy constraint only works if all
variables are already assigned? Don't think about a double as result but try
to think (just for the sake of argument) to express the result of the energy
function as an integer (with some approximation). Then it would be a
constraint between the problem variables and the variable for the energy.

The thing from which search can benefit is just the opposite case: you put a
constraint on the energy variable (derived from a solution found earlier by
search) and there is propagation that narrows down the potential values for
your problem variables.

Waiting for all the problem variables until they become assigned, then (as I
tried to express before) normal search will do as branch and bound search
offers no advantage. Even implementing a propagator that waits until all
variables become assigned and then computes an energy value would not help.
All of this is equivalent to:
	- find a first solution and compute its energy value
      - keep finding all solutions and discard the worse ones and update to
the better ones
And this, of course, is not really feasible for most problems!

Christian

Hi Denys,

the assertion is correct: this function is called by a worker that has
successfully stolen new work for search. As there is at least one other busy
worker (the worker from which the work got stolen) it is really meant to be
> 0.

Alas, it looks as if there is a bug. Which engine? Which problem? How many
cores? Aaargh...

engine : bab with 2 threads
problem: don't know how to answer that question. it's an NLP application
         that we have developed
cores  : Core 2 Duo

I was actually chasing another bug in parallel search where gecode
segfaults when deleting a space in a worker.  I recompiled with
--enable-debug.  It often takes several tries under gdb to observe the
problem.  This time I got a different problem, which is the one I
reported.

Do you use anything inside your application on which we could easily blame
the bug ;-)  Such as home-brewed propagators, branchers, etc?

Seriously, would there be an opportunity to run your application on my
machine?

Hi Guido,

thank you for your reply. I was hoping for some other news :) 
Apart from tweaking Qt-creator, I am considering another option: to install a virtualization machine (such as bochs) with linux + Qt-SDK on it.

Cheers,

Yannick

It seems to be possible to use Qt-creator with the Microsoft compiler.  Here's a thread on that topic:
http://lists.trolltech.com/pipermail/qt-creator/2009-January/001361.html

You may have to compile Qt-creator yourself, though.

I have never tried bochs, but I can recommend VirtualBox.

thanks a lot for the URL. 
Nokia provides users with a binary version of Qt-4.6.1 compiled using msvc.
Thus, I downloaded Qt-creator-1.3.1's sources, and I am now in the middle of their compilation using msvc.

Thanks for the pointer. VirtualBox seems great, alas the open source version does not come as a binary, and its compilation depends on (too) many requirements. 

Cheers,

Yannick

Hi,

I confirm that the compilation of Qt-creator 1.3.1 using msvc-2008 does not raise any problem (NB: it needs having Qt-4.6.1 for msvc installed, and takes about 1 hour on a netbook).

Then, from the Qt profile related to our gecode program, qmake automatically creates a makefile pointing on Gecode lib and include repositories.

Only one fix was needed in the automatically-generated makefile: msvc was called with option "-Wextra" which made it crash. I had to remove this option, then compilation went on.

Regarding Gecode, everything seems to work fine, but it seems gcc and msvc does not rely on the same specification, e.g. a declaration of the form:
    int table_id [ size ];
raises an error when compiling with msvc.

As bochs is an open-source initiative, I'd like to try it first. Its installation from the binary file went well. I'll now install a linux on the VM.

Thanks again for your help,
cheers,

Yannick

Ok, good to know that it works.

That's because it is not standard C++ but a gcc-specific extension.

Message-ID: <177D365B-877A-4EF8-8B17-28DBFC4BDFB5@cs.nyu.edu>

Hi, all:

My colleagues and I are working on a user interface research project that uses Gecode internally to solve integer set problems.  Our experiences with Gecode have been excellent; we are limited mostly by our lack of knowledge in the field of constraint programming.

In our application, the constraints in our problems come from the user via a domain-appropriate user interface and we translate them into Gecode equivalents.  The difficulty is that the user might specify constraints that lead to no solutions being found at all.  Our users are not experts.

What we'd like to do is give the user feedback about what they can do to best fix the situation, or possibly fix the situation for them.  In particular, the constraints that come from the user are not necessarily set in stone -- they are vague and messy, a problem with humans. ;)  For our application, it is far better to ignore a constraint and come up with some solution than to not return a solution at all.  The user can then adjust and iterate to get to a final solution.

Is there some way to determine what was the "worst" or "tightest" constraint after a solution search failed?  I'm looking for some indicator that constraint A was easy to satisfy while constraint B was difficult to satisfy.  If we had that then we could suggest that the user drop B, or drop it automatically.

I could probably do this crudely by iteratively dropping each constraint in turn and counting the number of solutions obtained, but this seems unsatisfying in many respects.

Is something like this possible in Gecode?  It's similar in some sense to the problem of soft constraints, but we don't need a full general solution.

Any pointers or advice would be appreciated.

Thanks!

Adrian.

Hi,

Debugging failures in constraint programs is unfortunately a very hard
problem. A main problem is that the reasons behind a failure to find
solutions might be very global in nature. As a very simple example, think of
a ring of less-than constraints (x1 < x2 < ... < xn < x1). There is
obviously no solution, but the failure depends on all the constraints.
Removing any one of the constraints gives a solution (given that the initial
domains admit a solution that is).

One possibility would be for you to implement something like QuickXplain
[1], which was developed for use in an interactive configuration system. The
main idea is to find a minimal set of constraints that gives no solutions by
repeatedly finding constraints that when added lead to failure. If your
problems are not too hard, then this is probably a good idea and reasonably
e to implement.

Another possibility, that is more akin to what you are asking, would be to
use the afc. Afc stands for accumulated failure count, and is used for
branching heuristics. It simply records the number of times each propagator
has reported a failure. Note that the afc is a heuristic measure, in that
there might be many propagators that would have reported failure, but only
one does so. Unfortunately, while you can access all the propagators and get
their afc (using the Propagators class), there is no way native to Gecode to
connect the propagator instances with your model level constraints. That
means that you would have to modify Gecode itself to use the afc.

Cheers,
Mikael

Hi,
I just had the idea that maybe QuickXplain could take advantage of the afc values, even if you don't have the link between propagators and high-level constraints.  Simply take the afc of the variables, and first try the constraints that are linked to the variables with high afc.

Cheers,
	Guido
