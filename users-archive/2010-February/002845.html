<PRE>Hi,

Debugging failures in constraint programs is unfortunately a very hard
problem. A main problem is that the reasons behind a failure to find
solutions might be very global in nature. As a very simple example, think of
a ring of less-than constraints (x1 &lt; x2 &lt; ... &lt; xn &lt; x1). There is
obviously no solution, but the failure depends on all the constraints.
Removing any one of the constraints gives a solution (given that the initial
domains admit a solution that is).

One possibility would be for you to implement something like QuickXplain
[1], which was developed for use in an interactive configuration system. The
main idea is to find a minimal set of constraints that gives no solutions by
repeatedly finding constraints that when added lead to failure. If your
problems are not too hard, then this is probably a good idea and reasonably
e to implement.

Another possibility, that is more akin to what you are asking, would be to
use the afc. Afc stands for accumulated failure count, and is used for
branching heuristics. It simply records the number of times each propagator
has reported a failure. Note that the afc is a heuristic measure, in that
there might be many propagators that would have reported failure, but only
one does so. Unfortunately, while you can access all the propagators and get
their afc (using the Propagators class), there is no way native to Gecode to
connect the propagator instances with your model level constraints. That
means that you would have to modify Gecode itself to use the afc.

Cheers,
Mikael

</I>&gt;<i> Any pointers or advice would be appreciated.
