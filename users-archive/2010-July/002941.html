<PRE>Hi,

I have been modifying my code for the interface from ECLiPSe to gecode,
specifically the way expressions are handled. I have run into an 
apparent problem with reified boolean expressions. Up to this point, I 
have been posting these as a boolean relation, as follows:

tt(Bool &lt;=&gt; Expr)

where Expr is the boolean expression, and Bool is a boolean variable.

I have modified the code to post this as an expression instead, as follows:

Bool = post(home, Expr)

This does not seem to work, as Bool does not seem to be constrained to 
be the reified value of Expr. The documentation says 'post boolean 
expression and return its value' for the relevant post function, does 
'its value' means the truth value at the point of posting the expression 
(which is not known  in my case), rather than constraining it to the 
reified value of Expr as I thought?

[The actual code is a bit more complicated than the simplified versions 
I present here, but I think I have presented the essentials]

Thanks in advance for any information!

Cheers,

Kish
