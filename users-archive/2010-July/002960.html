<PRE>Hi,

Is there anyway to post propagators for domain constraints for IntVar 
(including setting it to a single value), without doing the propagation? 
I've just noticed from the manual that most dom() constraints (as well 
as rel() between an IntVar and an int) propagates, instead of just 
posting the propator.

The main reason I ask is that I do recomputation manually, by posting 
changes to a Space ('events', such as adding constraints) without 
propagation until all recorded events are posted, which should be more 
efficient than performing propagation every time. I use rel() when 
ECLiPSe sets a variable to a value, which happens frequently during 
search. If this propagates as the manual suggest, am I correct that this 
can make the recomputation more expensive?

I noticed the reified versions of dom() do not propagate -- is this one 
way of avoiding propagation?

Thanks and cheers,

Kish
