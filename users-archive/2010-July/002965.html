<PRE>Hi,

I am looking at some possible (non-default) behaviour with the ECLiPSe 
interface to Gecode. By default, (full) propagation happens after any 
`events' (calls to Gecode, approximately) that may change the state. It 
is implemented as a separate event, so it is possible to delay 
propagation so that multiple events can be posted without propagation.
However, looking at the code carefully now, it seems possible for a 
Space to not have propagated when I try to clone it, and also when I 
create a search engine for s Space.

In the documentation, it is stated that a Space must be stable and 
non-failed for cloning -- by stable I think this means there has been a 
full propagation. There is no corresponding requirement in the 
documentation (I looked at both the reference doc and MPG) about Space 
there, but cloning of space is mentioned, so am I correct in thinking 
that the Space needs to be stable and non-failed when a search engine is 
created for it (even if you are not cloning)?

Thanks and cheers,

Kish
