<PRE>Hi,

Is there anyway to obtain the domain of an IntVar as an independent 
object, preferably an IntSet? I looked at the documentation, and can't 
figure out how to do this.

The reason I ask is that in ECLiPSe finite domain library, ic, there are 
some operations which are performed on domains as independent objects 
(i.e. independent of their original variables), including performing 
such set-like operations like forming the union of two domains, etc.).

Thanks and cheers,

Kish
