Ah, this is the part I did not know (that you might not be using the 
same variable). This is indeed different from what ECLiPSe (and most 
likely other backtracking constraint solver) does.

&gt;<i> This gives better choices wrt the heuristic than sticking to the original x.

</I>&gt;<i> x != n_0 is available.
</I>
However, propagation of x != n_0 can also occur with ECLiPSe -- it does 
not affect your selection of variable (i.e. you will still label x),
but it may reduce the domain of x and other variables. On the other 
hand, you perform additional propagations that might not pay off. Both 
of these value choices strategy are available in the search/6 predicate 
of the ic library.

I was first made aware of this difference in discussion with Helmut 
Simonis (who also introduced search/6 to ECLiPSe), and he said that it 
is not always clear which strategy is better, and depends on the problem 
  being solved, which is why both are provided in search/6.



&gt;<i> Let's take INT_VALUES_MIN as an example with x as selected variable with
</I>&gt;<i> values {n_0, ..., n_k}. Then a choice (x = n_0) v ... v (x = n_k) is
</I>&gt;<i> created. So, that's in fact the Eclipse style.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>
I assume you don't do any propagations here; as already discussed, it is 
not the only possibility.

I think it is also worth noting that INT_VALUES_MIN strategy is more 
expensive in a recomputation based system than a backtracking system, 
because in a recomputation system you need to remember all the choices, 
rather than just the value selected.

&gt;<i> I hope that helps. 
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Do you think it's worth explaining that in MPG?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
Yes, I think it is worth explaining. I had very great problems 
understanding the search chapter in the MPG (actually the MG then :-)),
until I had my discussion with Helmut. It was not obvious to me
that you had binary choices at each choicepoint until that discussion.
This was when I first started implementing the Gecode interface more 
than a year ago. However, the fact that you perform variable selection 
again was not known to me until your message today, so I think it is 
worth discussing both points.

Cheers,

Kish
