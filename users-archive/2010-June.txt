Message-ID: <9A031C22-451F-4532-B4E0-0E0A322E2CB0@gmail.com>

Hi all,

I am trying to weight different propagators implementing a cost function
"virtual PropCost cost(const Space&, const ModEventDelta&) const".

As indicated by the documentation "The only hard fact you can rely on is that a propagator 
with a cost value using PropCost::HI is never given preference over a propagator with a cost 
value using PropCost::LO". 

For my particular problem however I'd need to weigh propagators quite differently,
so they get executed almost sequentially, and simply saying LO or HI isn't enough. 
Does gecode offer another way to control the order of propagation?

Thanks,
Peter

Hi,

There are of course the normal cost values: unary, binary, ternary, linear,
etc. The system picks the cheapest, however some cost values are treated
alike. That is why there are no hard facts to be relied on.

But maybe you can give us an idea what you try to achieve?

Cheers
Christian

Hi Christian,

Most of the propagators I have implemented behave like filters: they get at
least one assigned variable and then accept or discard the assignment.

Some constraints are much more heavy than others and therefore I'd have 
them run after the less heavy constraints. 

For example

A -> PropCost::binary(PropCost::LO);
B -> PropCost::ternary(PropCost::LO);
C ->PropCost::quadratic(PropCost::LO);
D -> PropCost::crazy(PropCost::HI);

Can I rely on the fact that always A goes before B, B before D and so on?
It seemed to me that D would be run before all the rest, but that between A,
B and C there was not always a clear order.

Bye,
Peter

Well,

You are right that A and B will go before C and C before D but this is just
in the current implementation. We might change the implementation in the
future, though. The reason why we just approximate the cost values is that
each cost value takes memory.

So, the idea is: very often the cost is respected by the system. But what
you can't do is: you implement D such that it breaks if C has not run
before.

Does that help?

Thanks, that does help. 

I don't rely on running C before D, i.e. all constraints are independently.

Runtime will increase if I run C before D however, and anyways, if
C fails, there is no need to run D.

I'll rely on the unary, binary etc order of the current implementation.

Peter

Message-ID: <AANLkTins9HPMkGjnNvLeP2BzS0R1OXCX0skF1P5iuePt@mail.gmail.com>

Hi all,

I just wanted to document one issue I had getting set up, and how I resolved
it. I'm using the binary download for OS X users. I'm on 10.6 'Snow
Lepoard'. Section 2.3.2 of the Modeling and Programming with Gecode manual
directs OS X users to adjust the linker options to include ' -framework
gecode' but when I did so the linker complained of not being able to resolve
the Gecode symbols. Instead I added the framework by right-clicking on the
first entry under the 'Targets' group,  picking 'Add', picking 'Existing
Frameworks...' and then picking the gecode framework from the list. The
project (the send more money example) then compiled successfully.

I had another issue where I'd omitted the minus signs for the MONEY side of
the linear equation, but that's mostly down to my poor eyesight!

I'm looking forward to getting to grips with Gecode!

Oliver.

Hi Oliver,

thanks for the hints.  Actually, I had the same problems and already fixed the section in the MPG tutorial, but we haven't quite finished it for the next release yet.  Sorry you had to re-discover it on your own!

Cheers,

Well?

 

Depends on what you want to do: if you want to compile Gecode yourself, then you have to stick to 2008 (while the trunk can be compiled with 2010, the latest released version 3.3.1 cannot). If you want x64 rather than x86 you have to stick to 2008 anyway (the 64 bit compiler is in the Windows DDK and last time I checked it was still 2008 or you have to buy the professional version of MSVC).

 

Compiling your programs and link to the Gecode binaries we distribute should be fine with 2010 as far as we know.

 

It?ll be quite a while before we will start distributing binaries ourselves compiled with MSVC 2010 as we still have to figure out some packaging issues and last time I checked Qt as needed for Gist did not compile with 2010 either. Eventually we will change, but unlikely this year.

 

Hope that helps

Christian

Message-ID: <909284EBA2CAC6449F96CDFD973F20F8F89C@KIVEXCH01.AISystems.local>

Hi,

I am a (very) new Gecode user.  I am trying to compile and run the
send-more-money.cpp example following the direction in section 2.3.1 of
the "Modeling and Programming with Gecode" guide.  I am using Gecode
3.3.1 that I installed from Gecode-3.3.1-x64.msi, and I am running under
Windows XP Professional x64 Edition, using Visual Studio 2008.

 

When I compiled send-more-money.cpp I had some minor issues with
specifying the correct include directories, but I dealt with that okay,
and successfully created send-more-money.obj.  But, I cannot seem to get
the linking to work, as it complains that it is unable to open
GecodeSupport-3-3-1-r-x86.lib  That file does not exist on my system.
Instead, I have GecodeSupport-3-3-1-r-x64.lib, which makes sense.  But
why isn't it trying to link against *this* file?  How can I correct
this?  Do I need to be changing some commands to make it aware of the
fact that this is a 64-bit system, or something?

 

The command line compiling and linking text is reproduced below (sorry
about the lousy line breaks...)

 

Thanks for any assistance,

-Dan-

Hi,

 

As the MSVC compiler tells you, you are using a 32 bit compiler (x86 in
Microsoft speak) to link against a 64 bit library (x64 in Microsoft speak).
It does not matter what your operating system is but what compiler you use
when you decide which version of Gecode to install (x64 or x86).

 

As Gecode uses auto linking, the x86 compiler you are using tries to find
the x86 library which does not exist on your system.

 

You have two options now:

1.       Install Gecode for x86 and keep your compiler for x86.

2.       Enable the x64 compiler and keep Gecode for x64 .

 

Step 2. might be tricky if you have the Visual Studio Express Edition only
as it is only x86. If you have a commercial version you can enable x64 (but
I am not so sure how to do it in MSVC's IDE).

 

Hope that helps

Christian

Subject: [gecode-users] Linking Error Involving
GecodeSupport-3-3-1-r-x86.lib

 

Hi,

I am a (very) new Gecode user.  I am trying to compile and run the
send-more-money.cpp example following the direction in section 2.3.1 of the
"Modeling and Programming with Gecode" guide.  I am using Gecode 3.3.1 that
I installed from Gecode-3.3.1-x64.msi, and I am running under Windows XP
Professional x64 Edition, using Visual Studio 2008.

 

When I compiled send-more-money.cpp I had some minor issues with specifying
the correct include directories, but I dealt with that okay, and
successfully created send-more-money.obj.  But, I cannot seem to get the
linking to work, as it complains that it is unable to open
GecodeSupport-3-3-1-r-x86.lib  That file does not exist on my system.
Instead, I have GecodeSupport-3-3-1-r-x64.lib, which makes sense.  But why
isn't it trying to link against *this* file?  How can I correct this?  Do I
need to be changing some commands to make it aware of the fact that this is
a 64-bit system, or something?

 

The command line compiling and linking text is reproduced below (sorry about
the lousy line breaks.)

 

Thanks for any assistance,

-Dan-

This is something that I probably should have already known.  But, there
may be others like me, so perhaps a mention somewhere to "make sure that
the compiler version invoked matches the version of Gecode installed"
would not be a bad thing.

 

Thanks again!

For the sake of anyone else who runs into this same problem, I have made
the necessary changes and successfully compiled, linked, and run the
program.  Here is what I did.

1.       Went to:  Start -> All Programs -> Microsoft Visual Studio 2008
-> Visual Studio Tools.  Within that menu, several command prompt
shortcuts were available, including "Visual Studio 2008 x64 Win64
Command Prompt."   I ran that one.

2.       Using the (just opened) command prompt, I switched to the
directory containing send-more-money.cpp, then ran the same compile
command as before: cl /DNDEBUG /EHsc /MD /Ox /wd4355
-I"%GECODEDIR%\include" -I"C:\Program Files (x86)\Microsoft Visual
Studio 9.0\VC\include" -I"C:\Program Files\Microsoft
SDKs\Windows\v6.1\Include" -c -Fosend-more-money.obj
-Tpsend-more-money.cpp    Note that this looks a little different than
the version in MPG because of the extra "includes" that I specified.  I
think I could have avoided adding those to the command if I had chosen
to set up an appropriate environment variable for includes, but I
haven't tried that.

3.       After the compile command returned successfully (and the
send-more-money.obj file appeared in the directory with
send-more-money.cpp) I ran the link command, which now looked like this:
cl /DNDEBUG /EHsc /MD /Ox /wd4355 -I"%GECODEDIR%\include"
-Fesend-more-money.exe send-more-money.obj /link
/LIBPATH:"%GECODEDIR%\lib" /LIBPATH:"C:\Program Files (x86)\Microsoft
Visual Studio 9.0\VC\lib\amd64"   Note that this is different than what
I did before.  I am trying to create a 64-bit executable, so I needed to
try to link to 64-bit libraries which are in :"C:\Program Files
(x86)\Microsoft Visual Studio 9.0\VC\lib\amd64"

 

The linker ran successfully, created the exe, which also ran
successfully.  I expect that I could also have set this all up in the
Visual Studio IDE and not used the command line at all, but that's for
another day...

GecodeSupport-3-3-1-r-x86.lib

 

Hi,

I am a (very) new Gecode user.  I am trying to compile and run the
send-more-money.cpp example following the direction in section 2.3.1 of
the "Modeling and Programming with Gecode" guide.  I am using Gecode
3.3.1 that I installed from Gecode-3.3.1-x64.msi, and I am running under
Windows XP Professional x64 Edition, using Visual Studio 2008.

 

When I compiled send-more-money.cpp I had some minor issues with
specifying the correct include directories, but I dealt with that okay,
and successfully created send-more-money.obj.  But, I cannot seem to get
the linking to work, as it complains that it is unable to open
GecodeSupport-3-3-1-r-x86.lib  That file does not exist on my system.
Instead, I have GecodeSupport-3-3-1-r-x64.lib, which makes sense.  But
why isn't it trying to link against *this* file?  How can I correct
this?  Do I need to be changing some commands to make it aware of the
fact that this is a 64-bit system, or something?

 

The command line compiling and linking text is reproduced below (sorry
about the lousy line breaks...)

 

Thanks for any assistance,

Actually, given the command line x64 prompt, it should work as described in
MPG. I for one use x64 and MSVC professional 2008 all the time on my office
machine and there it does everything with the switches as described in MPG.
But it might be that Windows XP 64 is just a very strange beast ;-)

For the sake of anyone else who runs into this same problem, I have made the
necessary changes and successfully compiled, linked, and run the program.
Here is what I did.

1.       Went to:  Start -> All Programs -> Microsoft Visual Studio 2008 ->
Visual Studio Tools.  Within that menu, several command prompt shortcuts
were available, including "Visual Studio 2008 x64 Win64 Command Prompt."   I
ran that one.

2.       Using the (just opened) command prompt, I switched to the directory
containing send-more-money.cpp, then ran the same compile command as before:
cl /DNDEBUG /EHsc /MD /Ox /wd4355 -I"%GECODEDIR%\include" -I"C:\Program
Files (x86)\Microsoft Visual Studio 9.0\VC\include" -I"C:\Program
Files\Microsoft SDKs\Windows\v6.1\Include" -c -Fosend-more-money.obj
-Tpsend-more-money.cpp    Note that this looks a little different than the
version in MPG because of the extra "includes" that I specified.  I think I
could have avoided adding those to the command if I had chosen to set up an
appropriate environment variable for includes, but I haven't tried that.

3.       After the compile command returned successfully (and the
send-more-money.obj file appeared in the directory with send-more-money.cpp)
I ran the link command, which now looked like this: cl /DNDEBUG /EHsc /MD
/Ox /wd4355 -I"%GECODEDIR%\include" -Fesend-more-money.exe
send-more-money.obj /link /LIBPATH:"%GECODEDIR%\lib" /LIBPATH:"C:\Program
Files (x86)\Microsoft Visual Studio 9.0\VC\lib\amd64"   Note that this is
different than what I did before.  I am trying to create a 64-bit
executable, so I needed to try to link to 64-bit libraries which are in
:"C:\Program Files (x86)\Microsoft Visual Studio 9.0\VC\lib\amd64"

 

The linker ran successfully, created the exe, which also ran successfully.
I expect that I could also have set this all up in the Visual Studio IDE and
not used the command line at all, but that's for another day.

Hi,

 

As the MSVC compiler tells you, you are using a 32 bit compiler (x86 in
Microsoft speak) to link against a 64 bit library (x64 in Microsoft speak).
It does not matter what your operating system is but what compiler you use
when you decide which version of Gecode to install (x64 or x86).

 

As Gecode uses auto linking, the x86 compiler you are using tries to find
the x86 library which does not exist on your system.

 

You have two options now:

1.       Install Gecode for x86 and keep your compiler for x86.

2.       Enable the x64 compiler and keep Gecode for x64 .

 

Step 2. might be tricky if you have the Visual Studio Express Edition only
as it is only x86. If you have a commercial version you can enable x64 (but
I am not so sure how to do it in MSVC's IDE).

 

Hope that helps

Christian

Hey, you're right!  

I just tried stripping off all the additional includes and lib path
references that I added ,restoring the commands to precisely those given
in MPG---And now it works.  I had added the includes, previously, as a
response to compiler and linker complaints about not being able to find
certain files.  Apparently, the special command prompt shortcut in
Visual Studio sets up a lot of environment variables, or something.

 

I guess the bottom line is to be sure you are compiling with the right
version of the compiler, and everything should go smoothly.

 

Thanks again, Christian.

Message-ID: <584CEB10-A7BF-4AC6-A609-2A0BD6CF7D39@gmail.com>

Hi all,

I am wondering if a branching strategy can combine both

- variable picking according to their domain size (smallest first), can be done using  INT_VAR_SIZE_MIN
- constraint picking, e.g. to chose the binary constraint attached to that variable that connects with a variable
with a small domain as well

As an example, I have variables x, y & z, and domain sizes like x=10 y=10 z=1000. Binary constraints
are like x-y and x-z. My branching strategy picks a random variable of x and then ideally would first propagate
this change to the domain of y. However, I saw it propagates to z first. How can this be influenced, i.e.
how can the constraint x-y be forced to run before x-z, on the basis that y has a smaller domain than z?

Thanks in advance!

Hi,

No, that is not possible. But furthermore, it is not really clear to me why
you would pick a propagator? If the propagator needs to be run it will be
run. Otherwise, it will not.

Do you have some evidence that the default order of propagation is bad (or
even very bad) for an example you have? Or is it something you expect to be
bad?

If you really, really mean to exercise a very fine level of control over the
order of propagation you could use advisors for monitoring changes to
variables (see Chapter 16 in MPG) and in particular Section 16.4 on how to
force propagator re-scheduling.

Best
Christian

I am trying to expose as many as possible variables which are part of a propagator which triggered a failure. Before I execute a branch I store the accumulated failure count of all variables. Next I execute the branch and assume this one fails. Right after failing I query the accumulated failure count of the variables in the failed space, if it has increased I know the variable is part of the propagator that triggered the failure (if no constraints have been added). 

Is it true that the accumulated failure count of the variable can only increase because it has been part of the propagator which was part of the propagator which triggered the failure? 

I can see some problems which is if a propagator cancels an advisor on a variable or if the propagator is entailed, this decreases the accumulated failure count. This can happen before the failure was triggered and therefor the afc of a variable can decrease although it is part of a propagator which failed. Is this correct? 

If I would query the space which has been 'recomputed' to execute the alternative of the branch which triggered the failure, the afc compared to before the failure happened would be a good indicator if the variable was part of a failure, do you agree?

David

Hi David,

Let me try to give some reasonable answers:

 - I am not sure whether I really get the first question. But yes, in this
situation the AFC of a _propagator_ can only increase.

 - You are right, the AFC of a _variable_ can in fact decrease in the cases
you describe. It even makes sense: the variable has become less difficult as
less propagators that have failed in the past depend on it.

Actually, your idea of deducing something from the AFC before and after
sounds quite interesting. I would be very interested to know whether this
works for you.

Best
Christian

Hi All,

I am trying to expose as many as possible variables which are part of a
propagator which triggered a failure. Before I execute a branch I store the
accumulated failure count of all variables. Next I execute the branch and
assume this one fails. Right after failing I query the accumulated failure
count of the variables in the failed space, if it has increased I know the
variable is part of the propagator that triggered the failure (if no
constraints have been added). 

Is it true that the accumulated failure count of the variable can only
increase because it has been part of the propagator which was part of the
propagator which triggered the failure? 

I can see some problems which is if a propagator cancels an advisor on a
variable or if the propagator is entailed, this decreases the accumulated
failure count. This can happen before the failure was triggered and therefor
the afc of a variable can decrease although it is part of a propagator which
failed. Is this correct? 

If I would query the space which has been 'recomputed' to execute the
alternative of the branch which triggered the failure, the afc compared to
before the failure happened would be a good indicator if the variable was
part of a failure, do you agree?

Subject: [gecode-users] Gist in bab or restart search,
	abnormal exit in red nodes
Message-ID: <AANLkTikizJJ8A6pfGLJHyKvo9gsNjBhnbCjMVCFDI9U5@mail.gmail.com>

Hi,

In mode console my program runs well ... without any problem.
In gist mode either, except  when I try to inspect red nodes in graph for
bab or restart search.

The correct solution in green node I can check without problem, but in
bab or restart search, an abnormal exit graphical gist. ... these red nodes
contains  sub-optimal  or
poor solutions ...

The error in console is given by:

execution ...................  -search bab -mode gist

(<unknown>:3284): GLib-GObject-WARNING **: IA__g_object_set_valist: object
class `GtkMenuItem' has no property named `label'

(<unknown>:3284): GLib-GObject-WARNING **: IA__g_object_set_valist: object
class `GtkCheckMenuItem' has no property named `label'
terminate called after throwing an instance of
'Gecode::Int::ValOfUnassignedVar'
  what():  BoolVar::val: Attempt to access value of unassigned variable
Abandon

or ... directly with all solutions ....

execution  ................. -search restart     -mode gist

class `GtkCheckMenuItem' has no property named `label'
terminate called after throwing an instance of
'Gecode::Int::ValOfUnassignedVar'
  what():  BoolVar::val: Attempt to access value of unassigned variable

This problem with red nodes  in gist graphical are normal ... or what I need
add in my code to check these discarded solutions?

Hi,

The problem is that you try to inspect unassigned variables using the
val()-member in your code. See the marked part of the error message
below to know what to look for.

Hi

Thanks, really  it was the problem ... I fix it with a *try ... catch*, once
that I want a formatted output ... so the code is such like:

...................................................
try
    {

  for (int i = 0; i < mat_size; i++) {
    os << "\n" << i << "|"  ;
    for (int j = 0; j < mat_size; j++) {
      os.width(1);
      //os <<  matrix(i,j) << "  ";
      if ( matrix(i,j).val() == 1 )
    os <<  j << " ";
      else
    os << "_"  << " ";
    }
  }

    }


  catch(std::exception &e)
    {
      std::cerr << "\n" << e.what()
        << "\t  PRINT OUTPUT: NON DEFINITION for MATRIX YET" << std::endl;
     }
.............................................................................................................................

So, now in blue and red nodes .... the gist's message is:

BoolVar::val: Attempt to access value of unassigned variable      PRINT
OUTPUT: NON DEFINITION for MATRIX YET


Is there any alternative or better for this solution? Is there any function
to check if all the values of a variable are already instancied/assigned? In
this case,   the variable is a matrix.

Thanks
