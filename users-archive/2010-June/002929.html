<PRE>Hey, you're right!  

I just tried stripping off all the additional includes and lib path
references that I added ,restoring the commands to precisely those given
in MPG---And now it works.  I had added the includes, previously, as a
response to compiler and linker complaints about not being able to find
certain files.  Apparently, the special command prompt shortcut in
Visual Studio sets up a lot of environment variables, or something.

 

I guess the bottom line is to be sure you are compiling with the right
version of the compiler, and everything should go smoothly.

 

Thanks again, Christian.

Actually, given the command line x64 prompt, it should work as described
in MPG. I for one use x64 and MSVC professional 2008 all the time on my
office machine and there it does everything with the switches as
described in MPG. But it might be that Windows XP 64 is just a very
strange beast ;-)

Subject: RE: [gecode-users] Linking Error

For the sake of anyone else who runs into this same problem, I have made
the necessary changes and successfully compiled, linked, and run the
program.  Here is what I did.

1.       Went to:  Start -&gt; All Programs -&gt; Microsoft Visual Studio 2008
-&gt; Visual Studio Tools.  Within that menu, several command prompt
shortcuts were available, including &quot;Visual Studio 2008 x64 Win64
Command Prompt.&quot;   I ran that one.

2.       Using the (just opened) command prompt, I switched to the
directory containing send-more-money.cpp, then ran the same compile
command as before: cl /DNDEBUG /EHsc /MD /Ox /wd4355
-I&quot;%GECODEDIR%\include&quot; -I&quot;C:\Program Files (x86)\Microsoft Visual
Studio 9.0\VC\include&quot; -I&quot;C:\Program Files\Microsoft
SDKs\Windows\v6.1\Include&quot; -c -Fosend-more-money.obj
-Tpsend-more-money.cpp    Note that this looks a little different than
the version in MPG because of the extra &quot;includes&quot; that I specified.  I
think I could have avoided adding those to the command if I had chosen
to set up an appropriate environment variable for includes, but I
haven't tried that.

3.       After the compile command returned successfully (and the
send-more-money.obj file appeared in the directory with
send-more-money.cpp) I ran the link command, which now looked like this:
cl /DNDEBUG /EHsc /MD /Ox /wd4355 -I&quot;%GECODEDIR%\include&quot;
-Fesend-more-money.exe send-more-money.obj /link
/LIBPATH:&quot;%GECODEDIR%\lib&quot; /LIBPATH:&quot;C:\Program Files (x86)\Microsoft
Visual Studio 9.0\VC\lib\amd64&quot;   Note that this is different than what
I did before.  I am trying to create a 64-bit executable, so I needed to
try to link to 64-bit libraries which are in :&quot;C:\Program Files
(x86)\Microsoft Visual Studio 9.0\VC\lib\amd64&quot;

 

The linker ran successfully, created the exe, which also ran
successfully.  I expect that I could also have set this all up in the
Visual Studio IDE and not used the command line at all, but that's for
another day...

Thanks Christian.  I thought it must be something like that.  I do have
the commercial version of Visual Studio, so I will try to enable the
64-bit compiler.

Hi,

 

As the MSVC compiler tells you, you are using a 32 bit compiler (x86 in
Microsoft speak) to link against a 64 bit library (x64 in Microsoft
speak). It does not matter what your operating system is but what
compiler you use when you decide which version of Gecode to install (x64
or x86).

 

As Gecode uses auto linking, the x86 compiler you are using tries to
find the x86 library which does not exist on your system.

 

You have two options now:

1.       Install Gecode for x86 and keep your compiler for x86.

2.       Enable the x64 compiler and keep Gecode for x64 .

 

Step 2. might be tricky if you have the Visual Studio Express Edition
only as it is only x86. If you have a commercial version you can enable
x64 (but I am not so sure how to do it in MSVC's IDE).

 

Hope that helps

Christian

Subject: [gecode-users] Linking Error Involving
GecodeSupport-3-3-1-r-x86.lib

 

Hi,

I am a (very) new Gecode user.  I am trying to compile and run the
send-more-money.cpp example following the direction in section 2.3.1 of
the &quot;Modeling and Programming with Gecode&quot; guide.  I am using Gecode
3.3.1 that I installed from Gecode-3.3.1-x64.msi, and I am running under
Windows XP Professional x64 Edition, using Visual Studio 2008.

 

When I compiled send-more-money.cpp I had some minor issues with
specifying the correct include directories, but I dealt with that okay,
and successfully created send-more-money.obj.  But, I cannot seem to get
the linking to work, as it complains that it is unable to open
GecodeSupport-3-3-1-r-x86.lib  That file does not exist on my system.
Instead, I have GecodeSupport-3-3-1-r-x64.lib, which makes sense.  But
why isn't it trying to link against *this* file?  How can I correct
this?  Do I need to be changing some commands to make it aware of the
fact that this is a 64-bit system, or something?

 

The command line compiling and linking text is reproduced below (sorry
about the lousy line breaks...)

 

Thanks for any assistance,

-Dan-
