Hi,

In arc consistency algorithms, such the AC3 and its derivatives,  you need
do two choices:

1: Which is order of these variables are to be considered?
2. Which is the order of their  values are assigned to the variable?

These two parameters are in branch method, section 9.1., figure 9.1 ...
I am with some doubts on their meanings, such:
[INT\_VAR\_REGRET\_MIN\_MIN:]     With smallest min-regret.
The min-regret of a variable is the difference between the smallest and
second-smallest value still in the domain.

For example: considering  variables X and Y ... Dom(X)={2, 5, 8, 11}    and
Dom(Y)={1, 6, 18,  20}  .... X should be chosen
once |2 - 5|  has a small  regret ... comparing with |1 - 6| of Y ?

Other question, the parameter  INT\_VAR\_SIZE\_AFC\_MIN,  should the
well-known as *first-fail*?

Or INT\_VAR\_NONE,  first unassigned, should be the first variable found in
the list of pair (variable, constraint) considered
in arcs consistency algorithms?

Where can I find details of these parameters accept by the Gecode? In int.hh
are their specification

Sorry, your question does not make sense. Arc consistency has nothing to do
with search order.

The choice is made dynamically at each choicepoint, depending on the current domains.  So in your REGRET example, X would be chosen over Y because it has a smaller min-regret.  INT_VAR_ SIZE_AFC_MIN is not first-fail, it's "dom/weighted degree", see the tutorial documentation, Section 9.1.  First-fail would be INT_VAR_SIZE_MIN.
There's no (variable, constraint) pairs in Gecode, as Christian pointed out Gecode is not an AC algorithm.  INT_VAR_NONE simply picks, at each choicepoint, the first unassigned variable from the array.
There is no additional documentation except the tutorial and the reference docs you mentioned.  Just experiment with different strategies using Gist, you will see what choices they make.

Cheers,
	Guido

Subject: [gecode-users] a matrix with two lines complementaries by a OR
Message-ID: <m2se68bab891005060536rf5167f6bt6f6b2bfa59347b99@mail.gmail.com>

Hi

I am trying to obtain as result a matrix with two or more lines that are
complementaries in one.
Ex:
0|0 0 1
1|0 1 0
2|0 1 1

In this case, this matrix should accepted, once the lines 0 and 2  make a
bitwise with OR resulting in ONE.
The idea is a comparing in pairs the m matrix (idea from Guido, that I am
trying to reuse now ) .
 Each two lines I did a  rel(*this, L1 OR L2, aux)

Before to start a new comparision,   rel( *this , BOT_AND,  aux , 1 ); ... a
constraint that in aux-temporary this filled with one.

Follow part of the code, commented, as well the results:
...............................................................................................
  BoolVarArray aux (*this,  mat_size , 0, 1 );

     for (int i=0; i < mat_size-1; i++)
       for (int j=i+1; j < mat_size;j++) {
         std::cout <<  ":\n i:" << i <<  " j:" <<  j;
         // using an temporary array to store two lines per time
         BoolVarArray lines(*this, 2*mat_size, 0, 1);
         // from matrix target m -- copy two  lines
         for (int k=0; k < mat_size; k++) {
           lines[2*k] = m(i , k);
           lines[2*k+1] = m(j , k);
           // std::cout <<  ":\n | " <<  lines[2*k] <<  "| " <<
lines[2*k+1];
         } // two lines copied ... in an Array

         // from these two lines ...in pairs
         // a bitwise OR with rel ... considering this result in aux matrix
         for (int k=0, index=0; k < mat_size; k++, index++)
           {
         rel(*this,  lines[2*k], BOT_OR, lines[(2*k)+1], aux[index]);
         std::cout <<  " \n L1:" <<  lines[2*k] <<  " L2:" <<  lines[2*k+1];
         std::cout <<  " aux:" << aux[index] << " ind:" << index;
           }
         rel( *this , BOT_AND,  aux , 1 );
         //  index = 0;
       }

;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
A content of matrix m:

    [0..1]  [0..1]  [0..1]
     0  [0..1]   0
    [0..1]  [0..1]  [0..1]

Partial results for a matrix 3x3:
:
 i:0 j:1
 L1:[0..1] L2:0 aux:[0..1] ind:0
 L1:[0..1] L2:[0..1] aux:[0..1] ind:1
 L1:[0..1] L2:0 aux:[0..1] ind:2:
 i:0 j:2
 L1:[0..1] L2:[0..1] aux:1 ind:0
 L1:[0..1] L2:[0..1] aux:1 ind:1
 L1:[0..1] L2:[0..1] aux:1 ind:2:
 i:1 j:2
 L1:0 L2:1 aux:1 ind:0
 L1:[0..1] L2:[0..1] aux:1 ind:1
 L1:0 L2:1 aux:1 ind:2

...............................................................................................

Maybe I need a matrix to store all the combinations ... and post something
like

     for (int i=0 ; i <  mat_size ;  i++)
       rel( *this , BOT_AND,  m_aux.row(i) , 1 );

but this number increase exponentially ...

Subject: [gecode-users] gecode on a red hat cluster with gcc 4.1.2
Message-ID: <AE69A733-D04F-421F-8C6C-D8EC30266BB4@gmail.com>

Hi all,

We're trying hard to compile gecode on a red hat cluster, however, we had to install
the gcc 4.4.3 in order to compile gecode, while the official gcc version for Redhat
installed in the cluster is gcc 4.1.2. However, besides the fact that updating gcc
is a tricky task, we ran into various gecode-unrelated problems.

Are there any workarounds to installing gecode using 4.1.2 ? (e.g. by removing
some of the components that are not crucial but need +4.2), or is this simply impossible?

Subject: [gecode-users] gecode on a red hat cluster with gcc 4.1.2

My first try would be to compile the code on a desktop machine and then ship the executable to the cluster (provided it's an x86 cluster, of course).  That way, you could simply link everything statically, and you're independent of the actual cluster environment.
I haven't tried compiling Gecode with gcc < 4.2 for a long time, but I'm pretty sure it wasn't just some components that wouldn't compile, but data structures in the very core of Gecode.  Some things (mostly in the set constraints module, I think) were even miscompiled, so the code would simply crash although it was actually correct.  That's why we decided not to support old versions of gcc any longer.

Subject: [gecode-users] Matrix with two or more lines in one,
	or in matrix elements, assign
Message-ID: <k2me68bab891005070327j13776d5am413f48ee366de672@mail.gmail.com>

Hi

I am trying to obtain as result a matrix with two or more lines that are
complementaries in one.
Ex:
0|0 0 1
1|0 1 0
2|0 1 1

In this case, this matrix should accepted, once the lines 0 and 2  make a
bitwise with OR resulting in 1 ....
Since yesterday I have some advances but with difficulties in types and
operation allowed in matrix element ....
the algorithm was simplified to:
.................................................................................................................
 Matrix < BoolVarArray > m( arrqy_m , mat_size, mat_size);
 BoolVarArray aux (*this,  mat_size*mat_size*mat_size*mat_size , 0, 1 );
    Matrix < BoolVarArray > m_aux( aux , mat_size*mat_size,
mat_size*mat_size);
// a large matrix auxiliar to store all the comparisons ... the size's
complexity is the order n^3/2
.................................................................................................................

     for (int i=0; i < mat_size-1; i++)
       for (int j=i+1; j < mat_size;j++)
         {
           for (int k=0; k < mat_size; k++)
           {
              rel(*this,  m(i , k), BOT_OR, m(j , k),   m_aux(index, k) );
                 // here a  conventional OR  bitwise m(i , k)  or  m(j , k)
with result in m_aux(index, k)
               // I tried something with  BoolVar x(*this, 0,1);
                }

      // NEXT LINE in m_aux
         index++;
         }


Finally, post all the lines filled with 1 in its line

   for (int i=0 ; i <  index ;  i++)
     {
       rel( *this , BOT_AND,  m_aux.row(i) , 1 );
     }


Problems/Difficuties:

a) How to make a conventional or m(i , k), and  m(j , k),  ... assigning its
result in  m_aux(index, k) ?
 BoolVar x1(*this, 0,1);
 BoolVar x2(*this, 0,1);
 x1 =  m(i , k);
 x2 =  m(j , k);
Up to here works fine
  m_aux(index, k) =  x1 || x2;   This atribuition presents problem   ?????

b) In last for, the constraint in over a full line of matrix. Is it possible
to post only some cols of this
matrix, once that the real result has a width of mat_size, by index lines
(number of comparisions)


Thanks in advance

This has nothing to do with Qt.  As you can see, the program throws an ArgumentSizeMismatch exception in a Matrix constructor.  If it happens after double-clicking on the root node, then it means that in your print function you initialize a matrix with wrong parameters (i.e., w*h != A.size()).  This often happens if you forget to copy the parameters or the variable array in the copy constructor.

why is it that the init methods of SetVar are private?  I was hoping to
create a SetVarArray, but then initialize individual elements
separately.  It is possible to do that for IntVars.  Is there something
special about SetVars that makes this impossible?

No, I just didn't see why it's necessary to have the methods since you can do

SetVarArray x(home,n);
for (int i=n; i--;)
  x[i] = SetVar(home,...)

And currently, the init methods don't throw exceptions if the arguments are not within limits.  I'll add that for the next release and make them public.

Cheers,
	Guido

(lightbulb appears over my head) damn... I didn't realize you could do
that! thanks!

but, regardless, I think the APIs ought to be as uniform as possible
(principle of least surprise).  thanks for adding this in trunk.

Subject: [gecode-users] How to share living space object in Gecode 3.3.1
Message-ID: <9934264F-B54C-4645-BF5A-38B0A632F15E@univ-angers.fr>

Hi,

Before Gecode 3.3.1 I used the CopiedHandle to share an object between propagators in Space.
The propagators stored useful information in this object (for example the number of "EqDom" propagators).
These data are analyzed later in the branch-and-bound algorithm (which is a home-made algorithm).

In Gecode 3.3.1 the CopiedHandle disappeared, so how could I share this object ? Maybe there is a simple way which I don't know yet ?
Thanks for your help

Cheers,
Vincent

The memory management of CopiedHandle was completely broken and beyond repair, so we removed it. It may have worked for just exactly the case you used it for.  I have just started implementing a replacement, it may become part of the next release (or the one after that).
For the time being, you could use a SharedHandle and always update it using false as the share argument (false here only means no sharing between spaces - the sharing within a space is always preserved!).
Would this be a workaround for your problem?

Cheers,
	Guido

Hi Guido,

It works for my problem. The only problem occurs when deleting Space. Indeed, 
I didn't want to force the "clean" disposal of all my propagators, so some SharedHandle objects are not dereferenced.
I found a dirty hack to remove the remaining objects.

Thank you,
Vincent
