Subject: [gecode-users] Propagation for reasoning with models
Message-ID: <loom.20101106T114247-847@post.gmane.org>

Hi all,
We are using Gecode as a external FD solver for our system, which basically
reason about models. Our system is implemented in Prolog, and we rely in the
Prolog backtracking mechanism. We need to add and remove constraints from a
Gecode Space. As it is not possible to remove constraints from a Space, you
recommended me to clone each Space before any new constraint is added. 

Now we are planning a non-propagation mode for our system, in order to allow the
user the possibility of propagate or not the different constraints which are
added to the model. With this, we are trying to stablish a new configuration
reducing the spent time in the solver interface layer. However, I can not
inmediately implement this feature in my Gecode integration, as the Space
becomes non-stable and this forbids the clonning process. Would it be possible
to implement this feature in the context we are using Gecode for?  

Thank you very much in advance,
Nacho

Hi,

the only solution I can think of is to postpone the actual posting of the constraints.  Create a data type that can represent the constraints you want to post, then collect the constraints that you want to postpone in a vector, and only when you need the propagation, you actually post them.  When you clone a space, copy the pending descriptions over to the clone.

Cheers,
	Guido

Message-ID: <SNT131-w162386E03CE5D7053BE146A6320@phx.gbl>


hello,
 
i've a problem with domain constraint. i used it to filtre the domain of an Intvararray and it worked very well, i follow the example of MPG page 46:
 
i've an intargs a (some values) --> intset d(a) --> dom (home, x ,d)
 
but in my example this constraint consumes too much RAM (memory) 1,9 GB.
 
so i'm wondering if there is a way to fixe the domain of X with d.

Can you give us details about the domain d you are using?  If the domain has many holes, it is absolutely possible that the memory consumption gets very high.

i've a :intargs={10 random values from 0 to 199} 
 
then i do  d(a) --> dom(*this, X,d, ICL_VAL); so it works but too many memory is allocated for this.

I can't reproduce that here.  The following works just fine:

    IntVarArray x(*this,200,0,199);
    Support::RandomGenerator rnd;
    IntArgs a;
    for (int i=10; i--;)
      a << rnd(200);
    dom(*this, x, IntSet(a));
    std::cout << "t = " << t << std::endl;

Are you sure the memory is really allocated in that part of the code?

Cheers,
	Guido

i'm sorry Guido, i think you've not undrestand my problem. i want to reproduce this:


  ""  IntVarArray x(*this,200,0,199);
    Support::RandomGenerator rnd;
    IntArgs a;
    for (int i=10; i--;)
      a << rnd(200);
    dom(*this, x, IntSet(a));
    std::cout << "t = " << t << std::endl; ""
 
without using the the domain constraint dom because when i run this code in a big "for loop" peak memory reach 2 GO.

What kind of for loop?  I'm trying to reproduce the problem, but the above code works fine.  You have to be clearer about what exactly you are doing.  Please come up with a simple piece of code that exhibits the problem, not some pseudo code that leaves out the details.  Obviously, if you run the above 1000 times, you allocate 200000 variables and that takes a lot of memory, but that's not what you said in the original message.  
Calling dom (as opposed to constraining the domains directly) is definitely not the problem here, it does not allocate any memory except for the domain itself.

Cheers,
	Guido

i sent you a portion of my code. you tell me that there is an opposite way that constraint the domains directly. i think this is what i'm wondering for. can you help me on that.
 
vector <int> ITS;
IntVar array m(200, 0 , 199)
 int kp=0;
  
 for(unsigned it = 0 ; it < p ; ++it)
 {
 
  for(unsigned ig = 0 ; ig < t ; ++ig)
   {
    if (t3[0].e[it] <= t2[0].e[ig])
     {
      ITS.push_back(ig);
      kp=kp+1;
     }
     
   }
   
  
   int kq=0;
   IntArgs a(ITS.size());
   
   for(unsigned ft = 0 ; ft < ITS.size() ; ++ft)
 {
 
 
 a[kq]=ITS[kq];
 
 kq=kq+1;
 
 }
    
    
    IntSet d(a);
    
    
    dom(*this, m[it],d, ICL_VAL);
    
     ITS.clear();
      kq=0;
 }
 
hope this was clear

Dear Richard, Gecode supports pkg-config, so you can run, for example,
`pkg-config --libs gecode` to output all linker flags.

Hi,

we actually removed support for pkg-config a while ago, because it didn't work very well across all the platforms we support.  Currently, there is no standard way to find the Gecode installation.

Cheers,

We cannot support gcc 4.1.1 officially, it has serious bugs that are impossible to work around and that lead to code in Gecode not functioning correctly.
If you really want to try, you can work around the compilation issues using the attached patch (apply using patch -0 < gcc4patch, then run autoconf, then simply configure and make).  It makes some things public that shouldn't have to be public (but gcc < 4.2 does not implement the C++ specs correctly).  No guarantees, though - the code should compile and it may work, but it will contain subtle bugs, in particular in the set constraints.

Cheers,
	Guido

Message-ID: <AANLkTinr-5L0GmqQ_0mdunGxH1SeFxSq7KvYtNUmTJ42@mail.gmail.com>

Hi all,
We have developed  a new cumulative edge-finding algorithm and we need
to evaluate it on RCPSP  with the current best know implement provide
in gecode 3.4.2  (Petr Vilim). We are new user of gecode and we have
used the Microsoft Visual Studio 2008.  We have many questions about
the the cumulative propagator.

First of all, how can we integrate our edge-finding algorithm and used
the time-table and overload checking?

To print out the runtime in a .txt file, we modify the file script.cpp
but we didn't know the type of  stop(t, cout)?

The last but not the least question is about the setting of the time
limit. Where and how can we limit the runtime?
Thanks in advance.
Roger

Dear Roger,

That sounds very interesting. 

But first a word of warning: the cumulative scheduling propagator in Gecode
3.4.2 is still experimental: we ourselves have not fully evaluated its
performance and so on (the documentation in MPG marks the scheduling support
as still experimental).

As it comes to integration of your algorithm you might want to consult Part
P (Programming Propagators) in MPG (Modeling and Programming with Gecode).
Implementing a new constraint requires the implementation of the
corresponding propagator as detailed there.

The function stop(t, cout) stops the timer t and prints it on cout (a
standard output stream). Please consult the files:
	gecode/driver/script.hpp
	gecode/driver/script.cpp
In general these pieces of information are found best by searching the
reference documentation for Gecode.

As an alternative, when you want to print to a textfile you should redirect
the output printed in a standard shell to a file, so there is definitely no
need to hack the script stuff in Gecode.

For setting the time limit, just invoke the -help switch of any of the
Gecode examples. It tells you how (also consult Chapter 11 in the first part
of MPG how to use the commandline driver).

Best
Christian

Subject: [gecode-users] Edge-finding evaluation

Hi all,
We have developed  a new cumulative edge-finding algorithm and we need
to evaluate it on RCPSP  with the current best know implement provide
in gecode 3.4.2  (Petr Vilim). We are new user of gecode and we have
used the Microsoft Visual Studio 2008.  We have many questions about
the the cumulative propagator.

First of all, how can we integrate our edge-finding algorithm and used
the time-table and overload checking?

To print out the runtime in a .txt file, we modify the file script.cpp
but we didn't know the type of  stop(t, cout)?

The last but not the least question is about the setting of the time
limit. Where and how can we limit the runtime?
Thanks in advance.
Roger

Subject: Cost for values in domain

Hi, all

First,?sorry about the bad English.

I'm searching in MPG.pdf, but still didn't find anything.

Is it possible to give cost to values in domain? I have n variables, each one with integer domain = {-1, 0, 1}. But I want to give costs for each value in each domain, and minimize the cost of the selection, obeying some other constrints.

For example: for variables z, y, z, the costs for values {-1, 0, 1} are:

Cx = {50, 20, 30}
Cy = {30, 40, 30}
Cz = {60, 20, 20}

And I want to select x, y, z minimizing Cx + Cy + Cz.

I first tought in create a bool variable for each cost in each variable. So I would get 3X more variables, with contraint that only one shoul be true. And do something like this: maximize

b_1x*c_1x +?b_2x*c_2x +?b_3x*c_3x +?
b_1y*c_1y +?b_2y*c_2y +?b_3y*c_3y +?
b_1z*c_1z +?b_2z*c_2z +?b_3z*c_3z

Is there a better way to do this?

Thank you

Please check the description of the element constraint, it does exactly what you need: mapping values to some other values (or, with other words, generalizing array access by allowing a variable as array index).

 

The case studies in MPG also contain uses of the element constraint.
