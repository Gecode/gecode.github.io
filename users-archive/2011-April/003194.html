&gt;<i> Thanks for the tip about setting the commit and adaptive distance. That helps memory wise. In order to compile gecode for iphone one needs to set &quot;Compile for Thumb&quot; to &quot;No&quot;, in case anyone else wants to try. There are two more issues I'm having.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> 1) Is gecode thread safe, in general? In particular can I safely initialise a space and run a search on it all inside of a thread? This is important since one doesn't want to block execution in an iphone app.
</I>
Yes, no problem at all.  You just can't call methods on the same space from two different threads concurrently.

&gt;<i> 2) My executables, even after dead code elimination and other optimisations are very large. It's around 17 Mb. I'm not sure there's an easy fix for this, but any ideas would be welcome, for how to reduce file size of the executable. It seems that there are many features I'm not going to need, so perhaps I can try to strip down the library.
</I>
First of all, that sounds like you're linking statically, right?  It's true, the Gecode libraries are a bit on the fat side.  What you can definitely do is strip the debug symbols.  Other than that, I think the linker already only includes the symbols that it needs, so there's not much you can do in addition.

Cheers,
	Guido
