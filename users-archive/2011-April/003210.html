Ok. Great.

&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> 2) My executables, even after dead code elimination and other optimisations are very large. It's around 17 Mb. I'm not sure there's an easy fix for this, but any ideas would be welcome, for how to reduce file size of the executable. It seems that there are many features I'm not going to need, so perhaps I can try to strip down the library.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> First of all, that sounds like you're linking statically, right?  It's true, the Gecode libraries are a bit on the fat side.  What you can definitely do is strip the debug symbols.  Other than that, I think the linker already only includes the symbols that it needs, so there's not much you can do in addition.

Yes, statically. I'm not sure there's any other way when it comes to building iPhone apps. That 17 Mb is for a &quot;fat&quot; binary that supports two architectures (armv6 and armv7). So the real figure is about half that. Still it would be nice if it was smaller.
