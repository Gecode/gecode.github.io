Subject: [gecode-users] BoolVarArgs in unary Scheduling
Message-ID: <CAMAsEiY_Fk6E7mgBCTtkGnUoUTrhizi_msvKBnqyw_RJnsWLpQ@mail.gmail.com>

Hi
I want to use unary function for scheduling. I want to excluse some task
which are known to me from unary scheduling. I have read the gecode
document, I know that I can pass a BoolVarArgs to the unary function. How
can I give value to this BoolVarArgs in my program? All the examples I saw,
give value to BoolVarArgs in the model by constraints. I want to assign
value to this array in the main function.
Would you please help me.

Best Regards

Just use a constraint that assigns a value, that is, if you want to assign
the value 1 to a Boolean variable b, the following:

                rel(home, b, IRT_EQ, 1);

does the trick.

Message-ID: <CAMAsEiaPwJDrvh+vpfRhvkvGTEj3ztEnmNB5SoG8Naf-CYP9Yw@mail.gmail.com>

Hi,
I want to use dynamic arrays in my gecode model. We I new the array and pass
it to the gecode class, it says "Heap Memory Exhausted". I investigated all
gecode examples. All of them use constant and static arrays. In my project
the size and content of arrays varies. Why do you used const arrays in
gecode models? How can I use dynamic arrays without memory exhaustion?

Thanks for your reply.

Please, the best way for you seems to be to actually read a little in
"Modeling and Programming with Gecode".

 

In MPG, you will find a discussion of how to use arrays with Gecode, which
are of course dynamic (in particular, familiarize yourself with how variable
arrays differ from variable argument arrays). And of course, many (if not
most) examples use dynamic argument arrays.

 

Without serious reading there is no chance to progress in your project.

 

Christian

	assignment of values to variables
Message-ID: <1313397255.76210.YahooMailClassic@web15306.mail.cnb.yahoo.com>

Dear developer,
 

I am now trying to use CSP to sovle the problem of the assignment of values to variables. But I got a couple of questions. 
 
Problem description: 
 
Each time I input a number of variables each of which has a value domain to the CSP solver, and a couple of constrains 
(e.g. in the string form, put in a vector). That is to say, each time the number of variables and constraints are changing.

For example, 
 
variables: x,y;                 //which you will get from a vector (in c++)
value domains: x: 1-5; y: 1-3;  //which you will also get from a vector
constraints: x==y               //it can be any boolean expression, and can be got from a string vector.
 
For this, I should get the following results:
x, y
1, 1
2, 2
3, 3
That is, we will get each assignment.
 
Questions: 
-- how to define a dynamic IntVarArray given a variable name vector e.g. a vector that stores x and y
-- How to read constraints (in the string form) from a vector, e.g. a vector that stores "x==y" or other constraints. 
That is, each time we use different constraints.

Could you please give me some suggestions or answers about these questions? 

Thank you very much.

Hi,

 

The problem to parse the meaning of a string has really nothing to do with constraint programming or Gecode. Please consult a textbook on compilers on how to parse a string.

Hi,
that problem isn't related to Gecode, it looks like your installation of Visual Studio is broken (try re-installing).

Subject: [gecode-users] how to link Gecode to microsoft visual studio

 



Dear developers,

     My computer configuration: 
     - Windows Vista, 64-bit

     Microsof visual studio configuration:
    - version 2008
    - debug (or ) setting: Win32
 

     I installed Gecode ( Windows x86 (32 bit), 2008 ), and I got the
following error: unable to locate component,  can not find
GecodeSupport-3-6-0-d-x86.dll.

    So I want to know how I can use Gecode on the debug (or ) setting: Win32
of Microsof visual studio in this computer?   By the way, I would not like
to change the debug setting to Win64.

    Could you please let me know how I can let it work?

    Thank you very much.
    Fei Liu

You can try setting the environment variables by hand, see
http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/1700bbwd(v=VS.100).aspx

Other than that, no idea what could go wrong.

Further, I went to Windows command line and type "cl", the same scene happened again. I checked that the Gecode has created a GECODEDIR variable and updated the PATH value. Hope you guys can help me.

Hi Guys,

When I compile my script by Visual Studio Command Prompt, where should I put
my source files (i.e. the path to put my C++ source file)?

regards,
Yong

Please, this is again not a Gecode question. Please, familiarize yourself
with how to use Visual Studio. This is a mailing list for grown-ups.

Subject: [gecode-users] Compile problem
Message-ID: <1313679379.78256.YahooMailClassic@web15303.mail.cnb.yahoo.com>

Dear Developers,

???? According to the precedure in the section of? Modeling and Programming with Gecode, I tried to compile Gecode by myself.

??? My configuration:
???? - Windows Vista, 64-bit
???? - Microsof visual studio 2008 professional.
???? - Cygwin

??? Everything is ok (from configure to make to make install), but I can not open any file when I use them in Microsof visual studio.

??? I also noticed that in your manual, you said that to compile on Cygwin, but link against to windows libraries instead of the Cygwin libraries, using the following command 
??? ./configure CC= "gcc-4 -mno-Cygwin" CXX= "g++-4 -mno-Cygwin"

??? However, I do not use GCC, but Microsof visual studio. Do you think this is where the problem occurs?? How to set it if I use the compiler of Microsof visual studio?

??? Thank you very much.
???? Fei Liu

Dear all, 
 
        The initial domain of the Golomn ruler problem is set to be [(1 << (opt.size()+1))-1], while I think it should be [(1 << (opt.size()-1))-1].
       Can someone help make sure?

Thanks!

Yes, you are right! Fixed in the trunk.

Subject: [gecode-users] Gecode 3.7.0 released
Message-ID: <0E4723DF-C81F-4B19-A8C3-EE355A6C4BFF@gecode.org>

Dear all,

we are releasing a new version of Gecode:

        Gecode 3.7.0
 http://www.gecode.org

This release adds and improves quite a number of constraints (total lexicographic order for set variables, membership constraints for integer variables, counting constraints for integer variables using integer sets, range, roots, set element constraints for integer variables, number of values for integer variables). All of these constraints (and some more) are now also available in FlatZinc. Additionally, some fixes and improvements.

This release is an important milestone as Gecode now provides native implementations for all important constraints available in MiniZinc/FlatZinc.

The documentation of constraints in "Modeling and Programming with Gecode" now refers to the Global Constraint Catalog (for those constraints that are listed in the catalog). To give you an idea, Gecode 3.7.0 implements 74 constraints from the catalog and quite some additional not listed in the catalog.

The ones listed in the catalog implemented by Gecode are: abs_value, all_equal, alldifferent, alldifferent_cst, among, among_seq, among_var, and, arith, atleast, atmost, bin_packing, bin_packing_capa, circuit, clause_and, clause_or, count, counts, cumulative, cumulatives, decreasing, diffn, disjunctive, domain, domain_constraint, elem, element, element_matrix, eq, eq_set, equivalent, exactly, geq, global_cardinality, gt, imply, in, in_interval, in_intervals, in_relation, in_set, increasing, int_value_precede, int_value_precede_chain, inverse, inverse_offset, leq, lex, lex_greater, lex_greatereq, lex_less, lex_lesseq, link_set_to_booleans, lt, maximum, minimum, nand, neq, nor, not_all_equal, not_in, nvalue, nvalues, or, roots, scalar_product, set_value_precede, sort, sort_permutation, strictly_decreasing, strictly_increasing, sum_ctr, sum_set, xor.

On our web site, you find source packages, binary packages for Windows and Mac OS, and the full documentation.

Cheers,
	Guido
