Subject: [gecode-users] Reify (on trunk)
Message-ID: <87fwh49r86.fsf@univ-orleans.fr>

Christian, just a heads-up:
Reify without a default constructor means I can't preallocate a variable
on the stack and fill it later.  This is a bit inconvenient for the
python bindings.  Would you be willing to add one? pretty please? ;-)
Cheers,

Sure, will do. As you might have seen this is still very much in its infancy
and far from ready...

Subject: [gecode-users] Path constraint
Message-ID: <loom.20111218T212524-307@post.gmane.org>

Hi,

I might might as well say that i am a newbie at Gecode. I have been looking into 
creating a path constraint for the TSP example created by Schulte. 
As you probably know it implements a circuit constraint. 
What i have done is change the circuit constraint with a path constraint, and 
added a start and end IntVar. 
I have then altered the "Actual model" so instead of:  

 TSP(const SizeOptions& opt)
    : p(ps[opt.size()]),
      succ(*this, p.size(), 0, p.size()-1),
      total(*this, 0, p.max())

it instead says:

  TSP(const SizeOptions& opt)
    : p(ps[opt.size()]),
      succ(*this, p.size(), 0, p.size()),
      start(*this,0,p.size()),
    	end(*this,0,p.size()),
      total(*this, 0, p.max())

When i run it the program shows part of a route/path and then fails. My question 
is: Is there something which i have done wrong in the code provided?

Thanks in advance,
Henrik.

Hi,

What you do is almost correct. What you also have to take into account is
the following:
 (a) in the copy constructor used during cloning you also have to update
start and end
 (b) you have to change the print function: it assumes that all values in
succ are actually also positions in succ. So with your change, printing just
crashes.

If you had enabled a debug build of the problem you would have seen (b).

Cheers
Christian

Message-ID: <CADfnOYuEsT+O_mQxHhov3ammFi1tyLL9=uZ5sUuTfiK9SQEPTA@mail.gmail.com>

Hi All,

I met a problem of using Gecode against the Qt. Specifically, I have
installed the binary version of Qt-SDK and then I compile the Gecode source
code for installing. Latter, there is an exception says "Qt has not been
declared."  Could you give me some advices on how to configure so that I
can install Gecode? My OS is Mac. Thanks very much!

regards,
Yong

Message-ID: <CADfnOYu5cDmhJjYjv9R9uCWumGaX4KuR7E90qJExGwXkLhhEmQ@mail.gmail.com>

Hi All,

After successfully installed the Qt-SDK and configured the PATH variable(
path: /Usrs/***/QtSDK/Simulator/Qt/gcc/lib ) to make tools, such as qmake,
worked on Mac system, I encountered an additional issue. The compiler
cannot find the Qt library. Could you please give me some advices on
configuration so that the Makefile could finally find the Qt library. The
version of my Mac Os is 10.6.3; the Gecode version is 4.7.1. Thanks very
much!

regards,
Yong

Hi,

I usually simply install the binary Qt library (not the SDK!) from the web page, and all the paths and everything are setup correctly by its installler. You don't have to configure anything else for Gecode, as long as qmake is on the PATH.

Cheers,
Guido
