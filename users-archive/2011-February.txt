Subject: [gecode-users] Gecode 3.5.0 released
Message-ID: <2268B797-1ED9-42B4-9C4B-719BDCB965E5@gecode.org>

Dear all,

we are releasing a new version of Gecode:

          Gecode 3.5.0
   http://www.gecode.org

This release fixes serious bugs in parallel search, FlatZinc, fixes some DLL issues on Windows, adds support for FreeBSD, and adds STL-style iterators for arrays.

Also, Modeling and Programming with Gecode has been updated for 3.5.0 and contains a number of small fixes and a new case study on bin packing with an elaborate branching strategy.

On our web site, you find source packages, binary packages for Windows and Mac OS, and the full documentation.

Cheers,
	Guido

Subject: [gecode-users] Which version of MSVC on Windows?
Message-ID: <007e01cbc484$ad6ab5d0$08402170$@se>

Dear all,

There has been some discussion recently as to which versions of MSVC for
Windows are supported with Gecode.

The answer is simple enough: we support 2008 but 2005 and 2010 also work. As
a proof-of-concept we also built packages with MSVC 2010 for those who
already use that version. The 2010 versions are not linked on the webpages
but can be downloaded from:
	x86:	http://www.gecode.org/download/Gecode-3.5.0-x86-2010.msi
	x64:	http://www.gecode.org/download/Gecode-3.5.0-x64-2010.msi 

Now the question is: shall we make both variants available? Or is that bound
to create too much confusion? Shall we keep 2008 and wait until, for
example, Qt upgrades MSVC 2010 to a prime platform?

We would be interested to know what you think. And, of course, before you
write, check whether the 2010 versions actually work for you!

Cheers
Christian

 I think this could be useful, for example I want to use Gecode with MSVC 2005,
but I cant't compile it, and since the .msi version only works with MSVC 2008
I'm kindof stuck :(

 Maybe at least posting the steps for compiling the sources for windows would be
enough. I see that for linux there are scripts, so compiling the code is just a
matter of running a command. Compiling on windows is another story.

Please read MPG which contains detailed build instructions for Windows.

But the MSVC 2008 packages should work with MSVC 2005. Did you try? If you
failed what was the issue?

I did try it, I configured MSVC 2005 the same as I configured MSVC 2008.
(i configured the include/lib folders) and in MSVC 2008 it works just fine,
while in MSVC 2005 i get errors when compiling the same code

maybe this helps indentify the problem:

Hi,

Darn, I failed to see from your previous email that you had already tried
;-) I am very sorry for my ignorance!

I do not have a 2005 installation up. So there are different options here:
 - Stop claiming that Gecode works with MSVC 2005. How realistic is that,
anyone? I can't judge, really (my gut feeling being that a five year old
compiler is indeed old). BTW: We are way more aggressive in not supporting
older gcc versions.
 - We also test with MSVC 2005. This would be a massive investment for us
(already dealing with 2008 and 2010 is very painful), clearly slowing down
other Gecode activities.
 - Somebody keeps Gecode running on MSVC 2005 and sends us patches in case
of incompatibilities.
 - Anything else we could do?

Opinions, anyone?

Cheers and sorry again
Christian

Stating that Gecode doesn't work with MSVC 2005 is too much, 
since the problem is that the download version is compiled MSVC 2008,
and compiling with MSVC 2005 would probably work.

If testing with 2005 is to much another solution would be to let
people who are interested in using the MSVC 2005 version compile
Gecode themselves.

I for one don't expect to find a MSVC 2005 version
on the download list, since it is as you say a old compiler, 
but having the scripts used for compiling the windows version
would be very useful, probably enough, I tried to compile it myself, 
but it's hard without the windows scripts.

So my suggestion: not officially support Gecode for MSVC 2005, 
but help anyone who needs it by posting the files used in compiling
the windows version

Well, the scripts _are_ available (check MPG for the how to), anybody can
build the same binaries which we distribute! The only thing not included is
the packaging into MSI files.  We are nice guys (we try at least)!

However, I doubt that it will make a difference: the error you mentioned is
likely then to show up while compiling Gecode.

So, the questions I asked remain as far as I can see.

Cheers
Christian

Sorry, you are right, I had an older version of the MPG
I will try to see if i can compile it for MSVC 2005 since i need it 
but tomorrow, it's late :D

You are right again, the error did appear when compiling with MSVC 2005,
I'll try to find out why some other time...

I checked Gecode with MSVC 2005 and there is no hope, it has too many flaws
to compile a current Gecode version.

So MSVC 2005 is not supported (it is also not any longer available as
Express Edition for download).

We will update the documentation accordingly.

You are right again, the error did appear when compiling with MSVC 2005,
I'll try to find out why some other time...

This error is a known bug in MSVC 2005

http://connect.microsoft.com/VisualStudio/feedback/details/101942/error-c2666-3-overloads-have-similar-conversions

and has a workaround, but I don't think it's worth it

http://connect.microsoft.com/VisualStudio/feedback/details/99178/the-compiler-declares-an-invalid-built-in-operator#details


Thanks for all the info, now I can continue, 
knowing that It's that compiler that does something wrong
and not me :D

Well actually i still need to stick with MSVC 2005, so I modified the code to
compile with MSVC 2005, it's not that much work, only had to help the compiler
in deciding what type to use:

so what I did was to modify the files at the coresponding line

gecode\gist\gist.hpp(163)
gecode\gist\gist.hpp(167)
gecode\gist\gist.hpp(171)
gecode\gist\gist.hpp(175)
gecode\driver\options.hpp(362)
gecode\driver\options.hpp(366)
gecode\driver\options.hpp(370)
gecode\driver\options.hpp(374)

and do a static cast to int for the parameter of the 
call: someobject[mustcast]

like this example:
from:  _click[n_click++]
to:    _click[static_cast<int>(n_click++)]

I imagine that there is no use in doing this for the new releases yourself, but
if you want I can provide the modified source code to work with MSVC 2005 or
even the already compiled binary files (I compiled it only without gist because
of configuration problems with qt, but this should be fixed soon)

Actually, when I tried to compile Gecode with MSVC 2005 there were way more
errors than that (even central parts of the kernel would have to be
rewritten in order to compile as there seems to be a quirk with friend
declarations).

So the difference is between _compiling_ and _using_ Gecode with MSVC 2005. 

If you send me a patch I could add that to the trunk of Gecode but I would
still not say that 2005 is supported (actually, we just added a check in
Gecode's configure script that makes it barf if it does not find MSVC 2008
or better).

Cheers
Christian

I failed to notice that I have MSVC 2005 with SP1 and this is why I can compile

Subject: [gecode-users] question about channeling intvars<->set
Message-ID: <201102220106.03343.marco.v.correia@gmail.com>

Hi!

In the reference manual, 

http://www.gecode.org/doc-
latest/reference/group__TaskModelSetConnect.html#ga1bde4fb2947a0b93cf248e75e078969e

it says that channel(IntVarArgs x, SetVar s) posts the propagator for

{ x_1,...,x_{n-1} } = y and x_i < x_{i-1}

1. I'm not sure I'm getting the correct meaning. This means that the 
propagator also forces x to be sorted in increasing order, right?

2. If 1 is correct, then what is the most efficient way of enforcing a similar 
constraint but without the requirement that x is sorted? Should I use the sort 
global constraint on x to map it to an xsorted and then channel xsorted 
instead?

3. I guess there is a typo in the reference manual. In the latex expression it 
refers to y, where the constraint says the SetVar arg is called s.

Thanks!
Marco

Yes, that's correct.

That would be possible.  Be careful though that it will also force all x to be distinct.
Depending on the semantics you need, a more efficient version could be

   rel(home, SOT_UNION, x, y)

I changed the name of channel to channelSorted in the trunk, and added channel as an alias to rel in the minimodel.hh header.  I think it's more intuitive that way.

Thanks, I fixed it in the svn trunk.

Hi,

After Alin had provided me with a patch I added that to the trunk (not
promising that Gecode will compile with MSVC 2005 in the future though).

FYI: the patch is attached.
