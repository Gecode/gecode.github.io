</I>&gt;<i> Darn, I failed to see from your previous email that you had already tried
</I>&gt;<i>  I am very sorry for my ignorance!
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I do not have a 2005 installation up. So there are different options here:
</I>&gt;<i>  - Stop claiming that Gecode works with MSVC 2005. How realistic is that,
</I>&gt;<i> anyone? I can't judge, really (my gut feeling being that a five year old
</I>&gt;<i> compiler is indeed old). BTW: We are way more aggressive in not supporting
</I>&gt;<i> older gcc versions.
</I>&gt;<i>  - We also test with MSVC 2005. This would be a massive investment for us
</I>&gt;<i> (already dealing with 2008 and 2010 is very painful), clearly slowing down
</I>&gt;<i> other Gecode activities.
</I>&gt;<i>  - Somebody keeps Gecode running on MSVC 2005 and sends us patches in case
</I>&gt;<i> of incompatibilities.
</I>&gt;<i>  - Anything else we could do?
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Opinions, anyone?
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Cheers and sorry again
</I>&gt;<i> Christian

Stating that Gecode doesn't work with MSVC 2005 is too much, 
since the problem is that the download version is compiled MSVC 2008,
and compiling with MSVC 2005 would probably work.

If testing with 2005 is to much another solution would be to let
people who are interested in using the MSVC 2005 version compile
Gecode themselves.

I for one don't expect to find a MSVC 2005 version
on the download list, since it is as you say a old compiler, 
but having the scripts used for compiling the windows version
would be very useful, probably enough, I tried to compile it myself, 
but it's hard without the windows scripts.

So my suggestion: not officially support Gecode for MSVC 2005, 
but help anyone who needs it by posting the files used in compiling
the windows version
