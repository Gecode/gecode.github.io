<PRE>Well, the scripts _are_ available (check MPG for the how to), anybody can
build the same binaries which we distribute! The only thing not included is
the packaging into MSI files.  We are nice guys (we try at least)!

However, I doubt that it will make a difference: the error you mentioned is
likely then to show up while compiling Gecode.

So, the questions I asked remain as far as I can see.

Cheers
Christian

</I>&gt;<i>  - Somebody keeps Gecode running on MSVC 2005 and sends us patches in case

Stating that Gecode doesn't work with MSVC 2005 is too much, 
since the problem is that the download version is compiled MSVC 2008,
and compiling with MSVC 2005 would probably work.

If testing with 2005 is to much another solution would be to let
people who are interested in using the MSVC 2005 version compile
Gecode themselves.

I for one don't expect to find a MSVC 2005 version
on the download list, since it is as you say a old compiler, 
but having the scripts used for compiling the windows version
would be very useful, probably enough, I tried to compile it myself, 
but it's hard without the windows scripts.

So my suggestion: not officially support Gecode for MSVC 2005, 
but help anyone who needs it by posting the files used in compiling
the windows version
