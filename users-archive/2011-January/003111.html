<PRE>Hi,

 

Actually I have to admit that (as you found out) we have to tried to ignore
this as much as possible, in particular as MSVC 2008 and MSVC 2010 do and
require different things regarding manifests.

 

Okay, the first user has complained: we are going to look into it in one of
the next (if not the next) releases. Could I get back to you as a possible
tester of what we might do?

 

Thanks for letting us know.

 

Best

Christian

Subject: [gecode-users] Loading the C runtime library without using a
manifest

 

Hi everyone!

According to the last sentence in the last mail under &quot;Linking to Gecode
with Microsoft Visual C++&quot; you wait until somebody complains about the
absence of a manifest.

Well, I had some trouble loading Gecode libraries as I ran into the
Microsoft runtime error R6034 which is &quot;An application has made an attempt
to load the C runtime library without using a manifest.&quot; Since Gecode
doesn't come with a manifest, I added a &lt;dependency&gt; statement for the
needed runtime to the manifest of the calling application manually. So now
it loads but it seems to me that it would be &quot;cleaner&quot; to have this in
Gecode. Do you agree? Or am I mislead?

For the sake of completeness, I'm currently migrating to Visual Studio 2010
under Win7. By the way, the calling application is written in C#.

Best regards,

Alexander
