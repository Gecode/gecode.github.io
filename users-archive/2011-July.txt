Subject: [gecode-users] Gecode 3.6.0 released
Message-ID: <51095F8C-3714-41BC-B126-001985B27778@gecode.org>

Dear all,

we are releasing a new version of Gecode:

         Gecode 3.6.0
  http://www.gecode.org

This release adds new constraints (value precedence constraints for integer and set variables, no-overlap constraints for rectangles, constraints for Hamiltonian paths), improves and cleans up a number of existing constraints (scheduling, channeling, relation, bin-packing, lexicographic relations), and adds new functionality (support for externalization of choices for distributed search, support for incremental propagation).

Some models might have to be changed as the graph and scheduling modules have been incorporated into the integer module (removing the respective include directives is sufficient).

On top, there are many small fixes, in particular for FlatZinc.

On our web site, you find source packages, binary packages for Windows and Mac OS, and the full documentation.

Cheers,
	Guido

Subject: [gecode-users] IIS using undoing
Message-ID: <20110718080523.240360@gmx.net>

Hello,

i want to compute an "Irreducible Infeasible Set" (IIS) and some derivatives.
This means, given a set of contraints C that are infeasible i want to find the source of infeasibility.
I'm satisfied with a rather small (but not necessarily optimal) and fast approach.
A simple way of doing this would now be, trying to remove all single constraints from the set C and see if it is still infeasible. If yes, we can remove the constraint from the set.
In Gecode i could do this using a lot of copies of the Space, always posting the constraints again.
Instead of posting them again i could also use reified constraints and set all but one to true.
But here i also have to copy the space, as i can not ? undo the setting of a variable.
So is there a clever way of doing this abusing the Gecode SearchEngine ? (what i understood from the manual there is undoing instead of copying at some points).



The same thing i wanna do with a similar set C and a reified constraint x.
I wanna find the minimal (small) subset of C that the reified constraint x is still decided (true or false does not matter).


Thanks in advance for your proposals.

Best,
Max

Subject: [gecode-users] Initializing domain of IntegerVars
Message-ID: <20110718082127.262030@gmx.net>

Hello,

currently i have to create some IntegerVariables and some constraints, and i'm doing this using the IntVar/2 constructor, restricting the variables domain.

Due to some design decisions it could be necessary to change this to something like:

IntVar x(*this, MIN_INT,MAX_INT);
dom(*this, x,2,12);
or worse
BoolVar a,b;
dom(*this, x,2,12, a);
dom(*this, x,24,42, b);
rel(*this, a, BOT_OR, b, 1).


Afterwards i will do post further constraints and do search.
Is this bad in terms of performance, and if, why.

(I can understand that i have to post the dom constraint first, because sending a constraint already does some propagation.
Furthermore: does the second variant (with the BOT_OR) also restrict the domain of the variable?)

Best,
Max

Hello Max,

you may be able to turn this into a constraint problem that you can solve using the Gecode search engines, but they are also copying the spaces under the hood.  The only thing they may do different from plain copying is recomputation (see Sect. 7.2 in Modeling and Programming with Gecode).  There is no mechanism in Gecode to undo any changes to a variable domain.

Cheers,
Guido

You should use Gecode::Int::Limits::min and ::max here (otherwise you'll get an exception).

In some cases it may lead to less efficient propagators being posted (e.g. linear equation propagators exist in different versions depending on the variable domains).  In the case of the BOT_OR, it may be even worse if you search the x variables before the Boolean variables, because search will try everything in min..max instead of just the two possible sets of values (see below).

> (I can understand that i have to post the dom constraint first, because sending a constraint already does some propagation.

Yes, dom constraints have an immediate effect.

> Furthermore: does the second variant (with the BOT_OR) also restrict the domain of the variable?)

No, it doesn't (it would require something called constructive disjunction, which the BOT_OR constraint in Gecode cannot do).  In this case you'll have to preprocess your input data yourself to determine the smallest possible domains.

Guido

Thanks for the information.
Do you think that recomputation in this case could pay off?
Furthmore, to turn it into a constraint problem, how could i configure my search in a way that the reified constraint xb==x becomes true/false, without labeling xb.
I can not set xb to true/false, because i want the propagation of the other constraints to be the cause that xb comes true/false.

My first idea was double reification.
Consider the reified constraint set B=C are the set to minimize so that they still propagate x.
I do know the values of B.
I could post the constraints D=C with fresh boolean variables D.
Adding then boolean reified constraints (val(B)==D)==F.
So that F_i indicates that the constraint c_i has the predifined value(or not).
I could then minimize on the number of true F's(branching on F).
But i do not know how to ensure that x==xb will be decided.

Any ideas?

Best,
Max

Don't try to do that. You should always aim to branch on all the variables.

You could put them at the end of the variable ordering, where they should already be assigned. Also, it might well be that allowing them to be branched on early might produce the smallest searches, it is worth exploring the possibilities.

Sorry but you got me wrong.
I will elaborate a bit more this:
Consider decision machine (outside of Gecode).
It goes stepwise:
At first it decides to make
b_3=true
then i do propagation, nothing happens
Then it decides
b_1=false
propagation -> nothing
then it sets
b_4=true
propagation -> b_2=true is propagated


Now, the simplest reason for this propagation was:
b_3 /\ -b_1 /\ b_4 -> b_2
But maybe the constraint -b_1 was not necessary for this propagation, it is about some other problem.
So maybe only given b_3=true and b_4=true would also made the propagation b_2=true.
This is only a subset and a much smarter reason for the propagation.
If i would only test b_3=true nothing would be propagated, so b_3 is not the reason for b_2.

If i would now branch on b_2 the result of the propagation would always be
satisfiable, but i could not read information out of it.
I could not find out if the tested subset is enough to decided wether b_2=true or not.

I hope i could clarify the problem a bit.

Best,
Max

I don't know.  In terms of memory, possibly.  In terms of runtime, only if the search tree is deep.

You can't use reification to observe anything about propagation, there's no reliable notion of "cause" here.  The only thing you can observe are solutions of the problem, i.e., whether an assignment satisfies the constraints (including the reified ones) or not.  And for that it doesn't matter if the xb are labeled before or after the other variables (as Chris has pointed out).

Cheers,
Guido

Thanks again.
Last question according to this.
I finally only need a linear amount of calls to the status function of the space, but as trailsize can be huge i want to avoid overhead.
So consider i have a space with the reified constraints posted.
Lets call this the initial Space.

Now i do a copy of the initial Space setting all constraints b_1 ... b_n-1 to true. Calling status i can see if my constraint x is propagated or not.
If yes, i do not need to consider the constraint b_n anymore.

Now, in the next step, i do a copy of the initial Space setting all constraints b_1 ... b_n-2 to true. Calling statis i can see if my constraint x is propagated or not.
If yes, i do not need to consider the constraint b_n-1 anymore.
...
...

This means i need a linear amount of copies of the space (not at the same time but successively).
Can i somehow reuse parts of the propagation?
So, let n=150000, a lot of the propagation could be reused if it does not affect the constraint b_n-2.
So is there a possibility in Gecode that does (similar) things?

Best,
Max

What you're trying to do here is the opposite of search: during search, the variables become monotonically more restricted, so the propagation is reused in that sense (you only propagate the new changes).  Your variables become monotonically less restricted (you start with all being 1, then un-assigning them one by one).  Constraint solvers are not built for this kind of anti-monotonicity, so they can't reuse the propagation (they'd have to find out which constraints are not affected by the variable you are un-assigning, which is the exact opposite of finding our which ones are affected by the new assignment).

Guido

Hello everybody,

as variables in gecode need to have a domain, i want to compute the domain of the variables automatically, given the constraints.
I could also let the constraints restrict the domains of my variables, but as i understood, this is similar to propagation and could take some time.
There i want to restrict the domain manually for all unary constraints.
So, given a constraint "(a>5 /\ a<10) \/ (a>100 /\ a<105)"
the domain should be {6..9,101..104}.
Therefore i wanted to use some Gecode classes to compute the intersection/union/complement etc.. of the sets.
Am i right that i can use the Int::Iter::Ranges classes for this?
And second, how do they work?
So in this case, i would create a 

IntSet a1(Gecode::Iter::Ranges::MinMax(5+1,Int::Limits::max));
IntSet a2(Gecode::Iter::Ranges::MinMax(Int::Limits::min, 10-1));

And them somehow the intersection of this.
But i was neither able to initialize a set with a Range, nor to combine Ranges recursively.

So, how do i do this using the helping classes of gecode.

Best,
Max

The best is to look for examples in the code ;-) Just grep for it.

MinMax is nothing but a base-class for other classes and cannot be used directly. Look for the iterators that take arrays as input, they will do what you want.

Hi All,

I have recently upgraded my computer to 64 bit Windows 7 and new visual Studio installation. After this I get a bunch of warnings like the following and the compilation takes a long time. Worse, while running the same problem, the new environment consumes a ton of memory. Did anybody experience similar issues? Any feedback is appreciated.

Thanks,

Ashis

Well, as you do not tell which version of Visual Studio you use...

 But there are no issues: Gecode compiles and runs just fine with MSVC 2008
and 2010 both for x86 (32 bit) and x64 (64 bit). The MSVC 2010 compilers
seem to use more memory and seem to take more time, but that's fine. The
warnings you get can be safely ignored (we also test for warnings), somehow
you switched on the highest warning level where everything gets you a
warning (try the standard C++ header files to see what I mean).

I myself use Windows 7 and all the different versions of MSVC mentioned
above, so I can't real see any issues.

Hi All,

I have recently upgraded my computer to 64 bit Windows 7 and new visual
Studio installation. After this I get a bunch of warnings like the following
and the compilation takes a long time. Worse, while running the same
problem, the new environment consumes a ton of memory. Did anybody
experience similar issues? Any feedback is appreciated.

Christian, 

It is MSVC 2008 (Microsoft Visual Studio 9.0). Our IT installed that in my computer and it had several issues. I had to reinstall Windows SDK and a few other things. Now I can at least compile and run. But it appears something is not right as some memory spikes are really scary. Most importantly the memory spike does not occur in the old executable (that I had saved) when I run the same problem. Would reinstalling Visual Studio help? Is it common to have some visual studio files in "C:\Program Files (x86)\" directory and some in "C:\Program Files". Also I have two Windows SDKs (one C:\Program Files (x86) and one in C:\Program Files) -- is that okay? Would you point me to any documentation that have instructions for Gecode and Visual Studio configurations?

Thanks,

Ashis

Hi Ashis,

The memory spikes: do they appear during compilation or execution?

As far as Gecode is concerned, the installation of Visual Studio is
sufficient, no Windows SDK is needed. I am no expert as it comes to the SDKs
but if I remember correctly they also come with the commandline compilers
(at least they did).

Having files in both directories is to be expected if you install anything
better than the free express version of Visual Studio as these provide
compilers for both x86 and x64.

Documentation is in getting started in MPG but it is all straightforward. 

What I might do is to make really really sure that all old binaries created
are gone and that you do not accidentally mix object files from different
compiler versions.

Christian

Subject: [gecode-users] Compilation trouble in 64 bit environment?

Hi All,

I have recently upgraded my computer to 64 bit Windows 7 and new visual
Studio installation. After this I get a bunch of warnings like the following
and the compilation takes a long time. Worse, while running the same
problem, the new environment consumes a ton of memory. Did anybody
experience similar issues? Any feedback is appreciated.

Thanks,

Ashis

Subject: [gecode-users] Custom variables in Gecode
Message-ID: <B7BFDF96FFA3414F9997C38FE76F7DB238EE6605@EXDB1.ug.kth.se>

Hello,

I'm thinking of using Gecode as a solver in my project. However the first hinder I've encountered was how to define a space and variables in Gecode. (I have some experience with Gecode, when I used only IntVar-s)
The problem is following.
I have a set of objects with some properties of types such as string, double, integer, etc.
This set defines my domain.
The input for my program is an object that has dependencies on the objects from the domain. Apart from that the input object puts constraints on the properties of the objects from object domain. Here's an example:

--------------------------------------
InputObject O1
    property1 = "name"
    property2 = 4.321
    property3 = 2

    dependency1 = "objectName"
--------------------------------------

Space:
D1 {obj1, obj2, obj3, ...}

The idea is to select one or more objects from D1 such that the name of an object is "objectName" AND it satisfies the constraints (property1, property2, etc.). There can be dozens of objects with "objectName", but only few can satisfy the constraints. And this chain can be infinite, i.e. if selected object is obj1, it can also have dependencies on others (i.e. obj23), and it goes on and on.

The problem can be solved using DFS + backtracking. But I want to try Gecode first.

So the question is how to define an object in Gecode. Can it be expressed in terms of IntVar, IntVarArray? Should I create custom variable implementations, views, variable arrays?

Thanks!

Kind Regards, Dimitri Mazmanov.

Hi,

the usual way to deal with these kinds of more structured domains in CP is to map them to integer or set problems. In your case, this would mean mapping each name to an integer identifier.
I'm not sure about the infiniteness in your example.  You probably have a finite number of objects anyway, so what you're looking for is the dependency graph, which is finite, too.  Again, you'd model the graph in terms of integer or set variables and constraints.

Cheers,
Guido

Hi,
I have written my code like this:

  *SizeOptions opt("Scheduling");
  opt.size(5);
  opt.solutions(0);

  opt.search(Scheduling::SEARCH_BAB);
  opt.search(Scheduling::SEARCH_DFS, "dfs");
  opt.search(Scheduling::SEARCH_BAB, "bab");
  opt.search(Scheduling::SEARCH_RESTART, "restart");
  opt.parse(argc,argv);

  if (opt.search() == Scheduling::SEARCH_DFS) {
    Script::run<Scheduling, DFS, SizeOptions>(opt);
  } else if (opt.search() == Scheduling::SEARCH_RESTART) {
    MinimizeScript::run<Scheduling, Restart, SizeOptions>(opt);
  } else {
    MinimizeScript::run<Scheduling, BAB, SizeOptions>(opt);*

I want to know how can I understand wether the solver founds a solution or
it fails?
Thanks

If you need information on how the solution process goes, it might be best
to not use the ::run method but to invoke a search engine manually. Please
see Chapter 2 in Modeling and Programming with Gecode how to do that.

Hi, i want to use the wait function to get notified what a certain variable has been assigned.
And i want to do this for some variables, to finally to something with them.
so i want to have

wait(*this,a,&foo);
wait(*this,b,&foo);

And in my function foo i want to add the variables into a list or something like this.

void foo(Space&, Var a)
{
    do something with a

}

but as foo does not get any information about which variable has been assigned i can not use it.
Is there another method to find out/get notified when a variable has been assigned, without going through the list of variables and testing each of it.

If the expected function would like to have a boost function pointer this would be great.
Then you could bind additional information to figure out which variable.
This would also be advantageous if you have several Spaces running in parallel, there is no easy way to figure out which one triggered the callback.

Best,
Max

Sorry,

There is no way to do that but: define your own wait function. It is in fact
very simple: check the file gecode/kernel/wait.hh and just extend the
continuation called in the propagator UnaryWait. How to use it you can see
in gecode/int/exec.cpp.

Maybe we should change our wait functions such that they do what you suggest
anyway.

No, we do not want to have dependencies on Boost, but as said you can do it
yourself.
