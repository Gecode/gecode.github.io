<PRE>At first, thanks for the answer.

&gt;<i> First of all, just as was the case two years ago, nobody knows how to do
</I>&gt;<i> explanations for general propagators. The most interesting system for
</I>&gt;<i> doing
</I>&gt;<i> explanations in a CP-like system at the moment is the lazy clause
</I>&gt;<i> generation
</I>&gt;<i> research being done in the G12 project, where propagation is represented
</I>&gt;<i> as
</I>&gt;<i> a SAT problem. This requires a completely different system and propagator
</I>&gt;<i> implementation though.
</I>This shouldn't be a problem as it is an SMT system and therefore i will do lazy-clause generation. So i just need the reason for the whole (reified) constraint, not the single csp variables.


&gt;<i> Remember, propagators in a CP system contain advanced algorithms that come
</I>&gt;<i> from many different fields of computer science (graph algorithms,
</I>&gt;<i> numerics,
</I>&gt;<i> scheduling algorithms, ...), operating on variables that may have billions
</I>&gt;<i> of values. This is in contrast with SAT solving, where there is just a
</I>&gt;<i> single propagation rule over the simplest possible variable that needs to
</I>&gt;<i> be
</I>&gt;<i> explained, and the propagation rule is in itself very simple.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> What one could do without re-implementing all propagators is to simply
</I>&gt;<i> record all variables state before and after a propagator runs, and use
</I>&gt;<i> that
</I>&gt;<i> as an explanation. Such a recording would in most cases be huge (making
</I>&gt;<i> anything but the simplest possible problem infeasible), and also would
</I>&gt;<i> most
</I>&gt;<i> likely not be very useful.
</I>The size in terms of memory isn't that big problem, but the size of the reason (as you have to add all constraints to the reason that have a pruned variable in it).
This is why i wanted to add the ordering, which means that a reified constraint that becomes true/false only depends on the changed constraints that propagated before.

 It simply doesn't say anything useful: it is
&gt;<i> very
</I>&gt;<i> common for many propagators to cover a large portion of the variables, and
</I>&gt;<i> many times not all the variables are relevant to the results. Also, it
</I>&gt;<i> would
</I>&gt;<i> not suffice to just look at the most recently modified variables when a
</I>&gt;<i> propagator is run, the propagation performed might depend on all the
</I>&gt;<i> variables.
</I>That's right.

&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> As a practical note, adding the kind of bookkeeping that you describe
</I>&gt;<i> would
</I>&gt;<i> add quite a lot of overhead in many cases. As a comparison, simple
</I>&gt;<i> propagators for constraints such as &lt;, !=, and so on take on the order of
</I>&gt;<i> ten to twenty machine instructions to execute in Gecode last time I
</I>&gt;<i> checked.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> What is not clear to me is how you would like to use a hypothetical reason
</I>&gt;<i> that you would like to extract. Maybe there is something simpler that
</I>&gt;<i> could
</I>&gt;<i> be used?
</I>
I'm building a SMT like system (with ASP instead of SAT, but just consider it to be a SAT system).
So i have proposition variables for the reified constraints. Each constraint is either true or false.
This is why i would like to add a reason, why a constraint became false.
With this reason i can add a new Boolean constraint to my SAT solver which then saves propagation in gecode, as it can already decide whether a certain constraint is true/false.
I think there was once a work implementing learning in Gecode, i will contact the author to find out what he did. (But i suppose that he extended Gecode or did wrote own propagators, which i want to avoid).

Best,
Max

</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Sorry for reposting, i already asked this question 2 years ago, but now
</I>&gt;<i> i
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; managed to read more of the manual and my questions will be more
</I>&gt;<i> refined.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; For each constraint that i post, i want to find out which variables are
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; propagated by the corresponding propagator.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Also the ordering would be interesting. I need this to build an SMT like
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; System, to generate a &quot;reason&quot; why a certain reified constraint became
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; true/false.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; So can i somehow &quot;watch&quot; the propagate function, testing if the
</I>&gt;<i> subscribed
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; variables are pruned?
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; I first thought of &quot;copying&quot; the post functions of Gecode and
</I>&gt;<i> implementing
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; a &quot;wrapper&quot; propagator that wraps around the functions.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; But i think this will not do the work, as propagators can be disposed
</I>&gt;<i> and
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; replaced at runtime, right ?
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Do you have any other idea how i can find out which constraint is
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; responsible for pruning the search space?
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; I want to avoid to modify Gecode, as i want to stay up to date.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; This is also the reason why i do not simply want to copy all propagators
</I>&gt;<i> to
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; implement BookKeeping myself.
