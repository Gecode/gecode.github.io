Looking over the list archives, there appears to have been some work
done a couple years back on adding support for floating point values -
is there any currently activity on this topic in gecode?

Cheers,

Hi,

I need Float var for my work so I planned to add FloatVar to Gecode. I've just started the work but I hope to have a first alpha version before summer.

Cheers,
Vincent

Message-ID: <AANLkTimV-4ziadOB9nVo52Ud+uMGVesUra=c8pBp=OSo@mail.gmail.com>

Hi,

Actually, i'm trying to implement a musical CSP using GECODE; in this
CSP i have to define a set based on the result based on the result of
the multiplication of two IntVar (each one define the root and
interval of a chord) and int (this define the number of notes of the
chord).
My Question is: how i define the domain of a SetVar using a IntVar??
that's possible???

Thanks.

I'm not sure I understand your description.  If you have an IntVarArray x, and IntVarArray y, and an IntArgs c, do you want to express the following:

s = { x[i]*y[i]*c[i] | i in 0...x.size()-1 }

That would be easy to do (not tested, but you should get the idea):

IntVarArgs z(x.size());
for (int i=0; i<x.size(); i++) {
  z[i] = expr(home, c[i]*x[i]*y[i]);
}
rel(home, SOT_UNION, z, s);

Cheers,

Subject: [gecode-users] Trigonometric functions in Gecode
Message-ID: <AANLkTik-s7f46YYA-YbAJhtFfKhvvcvURc6mOAwkxgtf@mail.gmail.com>

Hello,

I'm a beginner in Gecode, so there is something that I don't quite
understand. First of all I understand that Gecode only uses integers. But in
my implementation I have to use arcus tangent which gives me some problems.
I have to following line in my code:

*for(int i = 0; i < p.size(); i++)*
* rel(*this, angle[i] ==
180/3.1415*atan((sqrt(sqr(coordinatesArray[i][0]-x)+sqr(coordinatesArray[i][1]-y))/constantsArray[2][0])));
*

Which gives me the following error:

*Error 12 error C2665: 'atan' : none of the 3 overloads could convert all
the argument types ...source.cpp 107 TSP*

Is there any way to work around this? I don't really have any ideas...

*Regards,*

It's simply a type problem: sqrt returns a Gecode::LinExpr, but there's no atan function that would accept a LinExpr as an argument. The only way to work around this would be to add propagators for trigonometric functions to Gecode, which only really makes sense if you have floating point variables.

Cheers,

If it's just for computing parameters of the constraint problem, sure, you can use whatever C++ offers. But you can't use constraint variables (i.e., IntVars) inside any trigonometric expression (I assume the coordinatesArray contains IntVars).

Subject: [gecode-users] consistency level for relations in MiniModel
Message-ID: <4D8A62A4.1090107@cisco.com>

Hi,

I am now looking at updating the ECLiPSe's gecode interface to the 
latest version of gecode.

I have been using gecode 3.3 for the ECLiPSe interface because I have 
been using the old facilities for LinRel and LinExpr, by breaking down 
user's expression (which may be non-linear) into subexpressions and 
posting them. It looks like this can now all be done by using the 
relation facilities of MiniModel, so I do not need to break the 
expressions down myself.

However, I am not very clear if I can specify the consistency level for 
relations and expressions I post using expr() and rel() of MiniModel. In 
my current code, where linear relations are posted using post, I am able 
to specify the consistency level. This allowed me to let the user (at 
the ECLiPSe level) to specify a consistency level for their (possibly 
non-linear) expressions and relations, with the understanding that the 
consistency level might not be achieved for parts of the expression 
(e.g. the non-linear parts).

I have been looking at the current Modelling and Programming with 
Gecode, in particular the MiniModel chapter, and it is not clear to me 
that you can specify a consistency level for rel (and expr). Can the 
consistency level be specified?

On a related point, the MiniModel chapter show example of specifying the 
expressions and relations directly in C++. In my code, I will be 
translating user specified relations/expressions to gecode data 
structures. In the existing code, LinExpr and LinRel are constructed
in my C++ code, and I will need to be able to do the same thing with 
IntExpr. I cannot find IntExpr in the (web-based) Gecode Reference 
Documentation, probably because I don't know where to look. I looked in 
the "Direct modelling support" page in the Programming models section,
but I found only the linear relations and expressions that I am already 
using.

I guess my first question (about consistency level) is also because I 
don't know which section in the reference documentation to look up the 
rel/expr facilities described in the MiniModel chapter.

Thanks in advance for any help and information!

Cheers,

Kish

Yes, no problem:

The problem is that there's no class called IntExpr.  In the code it's separated into LinExpr and NonLinExpr. We'll have to fix that (either renaming LinExpr to IntExpr or adapting the docs).  So what you have to do is construct a LinExpr, just like before, and then post it using expr or rel, which accept an IntConLevel argument.

> I guess my first question (about consistency level) is also because I don't know which section in the reference documentation to look up the rel/expr facilities described in the MiniModel chapter.

Right, the links are missing, sorry for that and thanks for the pointer.  I'll update MPG accordingly.  For the complete MiniModel reference, it's best to start from the MiniModel overview page:
http://www.gecode.org/doc-latest/reference/group__TaskModelMiniModel.html

Message-ID: <AANLkTi=21jMZ73znejtKQjFHJSMAymDM8n4Fv1Uk6qma@mail.gmail.com>

Hi,

I have the following problem getting a GeCode problem example to run on my
VS 2010. Any help would be appreciated - I might have missed some steps in
setting things up correctly.

I downloaded the package "Gecode-3.5.0-x86.msi" and installed it on my
system.
I then started a new project with VS 2010 and pasted the code for an example
"car-sequencing.cpp" into the .cpp of my new project.
I then went to the Configuration Settings of the project and added /include
and /lib as additional entries (for both debug and release).
I then pressed F5 to build and compile, the following error messages
appeared:

When running in the release mode, the error message states that there is
something missing from the "QtGui4.dll". No result.
When running in the debug mode, there is an error message "0xc0150002". No
result.

Thanks - I hope I can get the GeCode library started with your help so that
I can try out my model formulation there.

Andrei.

Did you follow the setup instructions in our "Modeling and Programming with Gecode" tutorial?

Could you check that the Gecode installer successfully updated the PATH environment variable to include the Gecode/bin directory in the programs folder, and that that folder actually contains the QtGui.dll and QtCore.dll?

Subject: [gecode-users] Using MiniZinc/GeCode in VS
Message-ID: <AANLkTimxgj6iYzt0sTSBtLM-trP=Fc3MafucXYos8RzU@mail.gmail.com>

Dear All,

Is it then possible to write a model in MiniZinc in the Visual Studio
environment and use the GeCode as a solver? I saw that there are
mzn-libraries in the GeCode directory...

I really like MiniZinc because it is easy and intuitive for me to model my
problems, but I still want to use GeCode given its speed.

Many Thanks!

Andrei

I haven't heard anything about integrating MiniZinc into Visual Studio.
However, whether or not somebody has done that, it is not really connected
with Gecode.

The G12 project that does MiniZinc has an IDE component that you might be
interested in. I haven't tried it myself.

Hi Andrei,

VisualStudio isn't the perfect environment for writing MiniZinc (did you mean the MiniZinc IDE?).  But yes, once you have a MiniZinc model, you can certainly run it through Gecode.  There's some information on how to do it on our FlatZinc web page:
http://www.gecode.org/flatzinc.html

You'll have to compile the MiniZinc to FlatZinc using mzn2fzn (have a look at the MiniZinc documentation), using the -I flag with the path to the Gecode mznlib (as explained on our FlatZinc page). Then you can run the generated FlatZinc through our fz executable.

Cheers,
	Guido

Dear Christian,

I have the following problem getting a GeCode problem example to run on my
VS 2010 (Windows 7). Any help would be appreciated - I might have missed
some steps in setting things up correctly.

I downloaded the package "Gecode-3.5.0-x64-2010.msi" and installed it on my
system.

I then started a new project with VS 2010 and pasted the code for an example
"queens.cpp" into the .cpp of my new project.

I then went to the Configuration Settings of the project and added /include
and /lib as additional entries (for both debug and release).

And then builded and compiled, the following error messages appeared:

1>..\queens.cpp(43): fatal error C1083: 'QtGui': No such file or directory

So, i have intalled the Qt libraries (added \include\QtGui and \include as
additional entries), and then i try again to compile and build the project.
But the following error messages appeared:

1>queens.obj : error LNK2019: external symbol "__declspec(dllimport) public:

The problem is that the Gecode binary package includes the Qt libraries but not the header files.  The queens.cpp example implements a custom visualization and therefore needs the Qt headers, but if you install Qt from the original binary package, the libraries won't be compatible with the ones in the Gecode package...
Please try a different example (one that doesn't include QtGui, e.g. golomb-ruler.cpp).  If you indeed want to compile against the Qt library, you will have to compile Gecode from the sources.

Cheers,
	Guido
