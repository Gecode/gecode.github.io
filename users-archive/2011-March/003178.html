<PRE>Hi,

I am now looking at updating the ECLiPSe's gecode interface to the 
latest version of gecode.

I have been using gecode 3.3 for the ECLiPSe interface because I have 
been using the old facilities for LinRel and LinExpr, by breaking down 
user's expression (which may be non-linear) into subexpressions and 
posting them. It looks like this can now all be done by using the 
relation facilities of MiniModel, so I do not need to break the 
expressions down myself.

However, I am not very clear if I can specify the consistency level for 
relations and expressions I post using expr() and rel() of MiniModel. In 
my current code, where linear relations are posted using post, I am able 
to specify the consistency level. This allowed me to let the user (at 
the ECLiPSe level) to specify a consistency level for their (possibly 
non-linear) expressions and relations, with the understanding that the 
consistency level might not be achieved for parts of the expression 
(e.g. the non-linear parts).

I have been looking at the current Modelling and Programming with 
Gecode, in particular the MiniModel chapter, and it is not clear to me 
that you can specify a consistency level for rel (and expr). Can the 
consistency level be specified?

On a related point, the MiniModel chapter show example of specifying the 
expressions and relations directly in C++. In my code, I will be 
translating user specified relations/expressions to gecode data 
structures. In the existing code, LinExpr and LinRel are constructed
in my C++ code, and I will need to be able to do the same thing with 
IntExpr. I cannot find IntExpr in the (web-based) Gecode Reference 
Documentation, probably because I don't know where to look. I looked in 
the &quot;Direct modelling support&quot; page in the Programming models section,
but I found only the linear relations and expressions that I am already 
using.

I guess my first question (about consistency level) is also because I 
don't know which section in the reference documentation to look up the 
rel/expr facilities described in the MiniModel chapter.

Thanks in advance for any help and information!

Cheers,

Kish
