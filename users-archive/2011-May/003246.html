<PRE>Hi Christian,

Thanks for your reply!

Well, I don't really know applications that well, especially with using 
lexical ordering in a constraint setting, so I can't say if any 
application relies on this behaviour.

However, being able to sort sequences of different lengths in lexical 
order seems very natural and useful -- dictionaries (for languages with 
an alphabet) relies on this.

I think in practice for implementing the constraint behaviour, you don't 
always have to extend the shorter sequence....

&gt;<i> 2) Just ICL_DEF which is as the algorithm by Paul Shaw, see the referenced
</I>&gt;<i> paper.
</I>&gt;<i>

OK, I see. I guess this means the propagation strength doesn't fit well 
into the predefined levels.

&gt;<i> 3) Gecode always chooses the best propagator, cumulative is a good example:

</I>&gt;<i> to have and Gecode posts the best propagator(s) it can for the constraint.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
Great, this is what I was hoping for, so I don't need to do all the 
extra checks to chose the right version of the constraint to call.

Thanks again,

Kish

</I>&gt;<i> Subject: [gecode-users] question about lexical ordering constraint and
</I>&gt;<i> others
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Hi,
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I have a few (more) question about various Gecode constraints that I am
</I>&gt;<i> interfacing to ECLiPSe:
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> 1) the constraint for lexical ordering
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> rel(Home, IntVarArgs, IntRelType, IntVarArgs)
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> requires the two arrays to be the same size. It seems the same restriction
</I>&gt;<i> applies in the global constraint catalog for the lexical ordering
</I>&gt;<i> constraints as well. However, the existing ECLiPSe lexical ordering
</I>&gt;<i> constraints does not have this restriction -- i.e. the two sequences of
</I>&gt;<i> numbers being compared can be different lengths. What is the reason for the
</I>&gt;<i> same length restriction?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> The lexical ordering for sequences of different length used in ECLiPSe seems
</I>&gt;<i> to be the natural one, where missing numbers in the shorter sequence are
</I>&gt;<i> replaced by 'bottom', i.e. a value smaller than any number.
</I>&gt;<i> So (using . to separate numbers in a sequence)
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> 1.3&gt;  1.2.5
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> 1.2.5&gt;  1.2
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> etc.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Could such a definition of ordering be used in the Gecode version as well?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> 2. What IntConLevel is supported in the binpacking constraint? I can't find
</I>&gt;<i> a specification for this in the reference documentation (in
</I>&gt;<i> doc-latest) [beyond the default of ICL_DEF]
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> 3. For various versions of the same constraint (e.g. cumulative), some
</I>&gt;<i> arguments can be IntArgs or IntVarArgs. In general, does it make a
</I>&gt;<i> difference if I always use the version with IntVarArgs, even if all the
</I>&gt;<i> IntVar has only one element in their domain (i.e. they are integers)?
</I>&gt;<i> I guess what I am asking is if (in general) Gecode does a check of its
</I>&gt;<i> IntVarArgs argument to see if they are all integers and calls a more
</I>&gt;<i> efficient implementation for the constraint if there is one? [I was
</I>&gt;<i> specifically looking at the cumulative constraint, but there are obviously
</I>&gt;<i> others].
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> The reaosn I ask is that in interfacing such constraints to ECLiPSe, I
</I>&gt;<i> currently don't check if such arguments are all integers or if they contain
</I>&gt;<i> some domain variables (IntVar). I can do this check, but if it is done in
</I>&gt;<i> Gecode already, there is no reason for me to do so.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Thanks in advance for any help and information!
</I>&gt;<i>
