<PRE>Hi,

Good day. Currently I am engaged in a research project which involves
integrating global constraints into SAT solving. I have built a prototype
system for the integration framework and have used GECODE as the constraint
solving engine.

In my prototype system, global constraints are part of the SAT formula (in
which a global constraint is represented as a Boolean variable) and the
GECODE is invoked whenever a global constraint is implied to be true by the
SAT solver.

Now I am stuck with a problem of GECODE.


In GECODE, is there any way to share a Space between multiple related
GECODE models? I want to come up with a GECODE program which will contain
multiple GECODE models (each will contain a CSP), but all these models will
be implemented in the same space.

For example, for the magic square problem of order 3, there are
3 'linear' global constraints for the rows,
3 for the columns, and
2 for the 2 diagonals (total 8 'linear' global constraints)

Instead of posting all the required 'linear' global constraints in a single
GECODE model (i.e one that is given in the Gecode\Example directory), I
want to post each of the 'linear' global constraints in 8 separate GECODE
model.
But, as these 'linear' global constraints are related, I want to post them
on the same CSP variable (i.e. on a global IntVarArray), to enable the
propagators for all the related 'linear' global constraints upon a View
change.
In essence, I want to come up with a program which will contain 8 GECODE
models, which individually models  each of these 'linear' global
constraints, but each of the models will share the same Space.


Thanks in advance.

Sincerely,
