<PRE>Right, it is not domain consistent, it just performs domain propagation. I
will update the docs accordingly.

But still, it does not succeed (it is not logically entailed) but it does
not fail yet (as it is not domain consistent). Try labeling Y and see what
happens.

Subject: Re: [gecode-users] semantics for count(Home home, const IntVarArgs
&amp;x, IntVar y, IntRelType r, IntVar z)

Hi,

I am still not sure I understand the semantics -- the constraint is posted
with domain consistency (the default). My understanding of domain
consistency is that any values remaining in the domain is consistent with
the constraint, i.e. the constraint should not fail if the variable is
instantiated to one of the values, as long as this is the only change made.
For

Y :: [3,4], count([3,0,3,3,4], Y, =, 2)

Y is the only domain variable with more than one value, so if I understand
domain consistency correctly, then instantiating it to either
3 or 4 should succeed, but doing so fails for both values.

The documentation states that:

Supports domain consistent propagation (icl = ICL_DOM, default) and &quot;almost&quot;
domain consistent propagation (all other values for icl), where y is not
pruned.

(I assume by other values of icl, you exclude ICL_DEF, which behaves as
ICL_DOM as that is the default)

It seems to me the behaviour is that y is not pruned in the above, even when
the constraint is posted with ICL_DOM and ICL_DEF -- I have explicitly
posted the constraint with ICL_DOM, to check if it makes any difference, and
it does not, i.e. the example with Y::[3,4] succeeds.

Cheers,

Kish

</I>&gt;<i> Subject: [gecode-users] semantics for count(Home home, const 
</I>&gt;<i> IntVarArgs&amp;x, IntVar y, IntRelType r, IntVar z)
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Hi,
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I have been looking at the behaviour of
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> count(Home home, const IntVarArgs&amp;x, IntVar y, IntRelType r, IntVar z)
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> and cannot understand what is happening when IntVar y has more than 
</I>&gt;<i> one value in its domain. Until now, I have only tested this constraint 
</I>&gt;<i> with y having a singleton value in its domain, and in this case, the 
</I>&gt;<i> constraint behaves the same as the case where y is Int, i.e. the 
</I>&gt;<i> number of occurrences of the value y in x is counted.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> However, one of my user wanted to use the constraint where y has 
</I>&gt;<i> multiple values (i.e. the counts constraint in the global constraint 
</I>&gt;<i> catalog). I know this constraint is provided with y being an IntSet, 
</I>&gt;<i> but my user did not know about this constraint, so he used the version
</I>where y is a IntVar instead.
&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I had expected that mulitple domain values in y would behave like 
</I>&gt;<i> multiple values in the IntSet for this constraint, but this does not 
</I>&gt;<i> seem to be the case. For example, the constraint succeeds with the 
</I>&gt;<i> following (in ECLiPSe syntax, but the argument order of Gecode's
</I>&gt;<i> constraint):
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Y :: [3,4], count([3,0,3,3,4], Y, =, 2)
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> where [3,0,3,3,4] is x, IntRelType is IRT_EQ.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I don't understand why this succeeds -- the count for 3 is 3, and for 
</I>&gt;<i> 4 is 1, and for both 3 and 4 is 4, none of which is equal to 2. So 
</I>&gt;<i> what is the semantics?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> The equivalent call using y as an IntSet [3,4] fails as expected. 
</I>&gt;<i> Also, for the same count constraint, if y has a single domain value 
</I>&gt;<i> (e.g. 3 or 4), then the constraint behave as I expected, i.e. z = 3 
</I>&gt;<i> for y = 3, and z = 1 for y = 1.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Thanks and cheers,
</I>&gt;<i>
