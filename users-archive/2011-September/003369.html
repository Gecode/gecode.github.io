<PRE>Sorry, the previous email had a small mistake: Gecode does everything right
for domain consistency when Boolean variables are used. The special case
that bounds consistency is the same as domain consistency is not detected
for integer variables (and will never be as the only case where it matters
is when all integer variables but one are 0/1...)

And frankly, don't use integer variables if they are in fact Boolean
variables.

Subject: Re: [gecode-users] Linear memory allocation

I tried the example, and everything works as expected, regardless of whether
using Boolean or integer variables (Boolean variables are much more
efficient, though, as the linear propagators are specially optimized for
Booleans).

The first solution is found after less than a second on my machine. I used
-c-d 500 and -a-d 500 for recomputation (remember: with O(n^2) variables,
the search tree is O(n^2) deep as the model has close to no propagation).

Gist also works just fine.

Changing to Boolean does not fix the domain consistency issue, it is the
same for Boolean or integer. Please note that for your example domain
consistency is the same as bounds consistency: for inequalities, bounds and
domain consistency is equivalent (and Gecode does the right thing by always
choosing bounds consistency). For equality (you use that for constraining
the Sum variable) in this special case domain consistency is also equivalent
to bounds consistency as all coefficients are unit and all but one variable
are ranges (they are 0/1) (and stupidly Gecode does not realize, aargh).

So I do not really know what your problem is.

</I>&gt;<i> Hello,

</I>&gt;<i> I have a model with 10^2 to 80^2 variables and linear constraints over 49
