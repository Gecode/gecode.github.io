The short answer is that there are more than one area that uses the term 
branch and bound. The CP usage of the term has slightly different 
terminology than the usage in mathematical programming*, but the main 
principles are the same.

There are lots of resources for learning how BAB works in constraint 
programming (lecture notes from CP courses at universities is a good 
start), and that does not really have to do with Gecode.

Cheers,
Mikael

* Essentially, the bounding of the math programming kind is actually 
constraint propagation, and the pruning in the math programming kind is 
the bounding in the CP terminology. One may argue the merits of the 
different sets terms (and of having different terms), but for CP the 
terms used make much more sense than the other set of terms would.
