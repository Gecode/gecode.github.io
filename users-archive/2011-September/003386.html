<PRE>Hi,

Gecode has several propagators with variants where an argument can be an 
IntVar or IntVal. In general, is there a (significant) performance 
advantage in using the IntVal version instead of having an IntVar with a 
singleton domain, if the argument has a known integer value when posting 
the propagator? Can a generalisation even be made, or will this depend 
on the specific propagator?

The reason I ask is that since I am writing an interface to gecode, I do 
not know how the user will call specific propagators, and it is much 
cleaner for me to write the code to call as few version of the 
propagators as possible, instead of trying to specialise for every 
variant of the propagator (IntVal or IntVar), especially if there are 
more than one argument like this, but if this seriously affect 
performance, then I guess it is unavoidable.

Thanks and cheers,

Kish
