<PRE>Hi,

I am in the process of adding support for the new features in 3.7.0 (and 
3.6.0) to the ECLiPSe Gecode interface, and I have some questions and 
comments about the documentation for the member constraint:

In the MPG, the text in the &quot;Membership constraints&quot; section (4.4.2 on 
my copy), says &quot;...for an integer array x..&quot;, referring to
member(home, x, y), I think x should be an integer variable array.

I also looked at the reference documentation to try and find what 
IntConLevel is supported for this constraint, and in the specification 
for the functions, there is just IntConLev at the last argument 
position, without a variable name, something like:

void Gecode:member(Home            home,
                    const IntVarArgs &amp; x,
                    IntVar             y,
                    IntConLevel
     	         }

It looks like this is the way the function is written in the source as 
well. I am not familiar with this syntax -- what does it mean, and does 
member support any IntConLevel?

Thanks and cheer,

Kish
