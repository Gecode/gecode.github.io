I am suggesting it might be a good idea to always describe the IntConLev 
argument in the reference documentation. At the moment there is the 
&quot;dummy&quot; argument for member, and it would be nice to add IntConLev icl = 
ICL_DEF as there are in other constraints, and to say what value is 
supported for icl, even if it is only one. In some cases, such as for 
some of the element constraints, and for precede, there is a IntCOnLev = 
ICL_DEF, but no description of the values available. I have in general 
assumed that this means that the constraint does not achieve any of the 
defined propagation level, as I think you told me for the scheduling 
constraints, but I am not so sure this is the always the case: for 
element, some of the variants do specify the IntConLev, and ICL_BND and 
ICL_DOM are available, so does these levels also apply to the element 
where IntConLev is not described?

For precede, the Global Constraint Catalog specify a domain consistent 
filtering for the constraints (int_value_precede and 
int_value_precede_chain), and I suspect this is what the Gecode version 
of the constraint achieves, is this the case?

Cheers,
