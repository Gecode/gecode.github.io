<PRE>Hi Christian,

I understand that doxygen may sometimes miss arguments. I assume this 
should be considered a bug, and if possible (and if you know how the bug 
behaves), avoid the bug by avoiding the situation that will cause the 
argument to be missed.

For the case of element (and also precede), are you saying that doxygen 
has a problem that prevents it from picking up the description of some 
of the variables? Here is one example of element in the reference manual 
that does not describe icl (even though it is listed in the 
specification of the procedure):

void Gecode::element	(	Home 	home,
IntSharedArray 	n,
IntVar 	x0,
BoolVar 	x1,
IntConLevel 	icl = ICL_DEF	
)			
Post propagator for .

Throws an exception of type Int::OutOfLimits, if the integers in n 
exceed the limits in Int::Limits.

===================
and here is an description that does give information on icl:

void Gecode::element	(	Home 	home,
const IntVarArgs &amp; 	x,
IntVar 	y0,
IntVar 	y1,
IntConLevel 	icl = ICL_DEF	
)			
Post propagator for .

Supports both bounds (icl = ICL_BND) and domain consistency (icl = 
ICL_DOM, default).

==============

I don't know doxygen at all, but is the text &quot;Supports both bounds....&quot; 
in the source for both of these, and a bug in doxygen is preventing the 
description from being generated in the first case? (I am assuming that 
both versions supports ICL_BND and ICL_DOM)

Cheers,

Kish
