<PRE>Ah, it looks that I did not understand your original email. I think MPG says
somewhere that if there is nothing said about propagation strength it is
domain consistent. It might even be true ;-)

But I think you are right that we should say it in the reference docs what
the propagators achieve and in many places we do. I'll go through the ref
docs and fix it for the next release.

Cheers
Christian

Hi Christian,

I understand that doxygen may sometimes miss arguments. I assume this should
be considered a bug, and if possible (and if you know how the bug behaves),
avoid the bug by avoiding the situation that will cause the argument to be
missed.

For the case of element (and also precede), are you saying that doxygen has
a problem that prevents it from picking up the description of some of the
variables? Here is one example of element in the reference manual that does
not describe icl (even though it is listed in the specification of the
procedure):

void Gecode::element	(	Home 	home,
IntSharedArray 	n,
IntVar 	x0,
BoolVar 	x1,
IntConLevel 	icl = ICL_DEF	
)			
Post propagator for .

Throws an exception of type Int::OutOfLimits, if the integers in n exceed
the limits in Int::Limits.

===================
and here is an description that does give information on icl:

void Gecode::element	(	Home 	home,
const IntVarArgs &amp; 	x,
IntVar 	y0,
IntVar 	y1,
IntConLevel 	icl = ICL_DEF	
)			
Post propagator for .

Supports both bounds (icl = ICL_BND) and domain consistency (icl = ICL_DOM,
default).

==============

I don't know doxygen at all, but is the text &quot;Supports both bounds....&quot; 
in the source for both of these, and a bug in doxygen is preventing the
description from being generated in the first case? (I am assuming that both
versions supports ICL_BND and ICL_DOM)

Cheers,

Kish
