<PRE>Hi Christian,

I am not sure I understand. From what I can see, among_var allow
Values to be a collection of domain variables (rather than just a 
collection of integers), and NVAR (the count) to also be a domain 
variable, and both among and among_var is defined for the = relation 
only, plus minor differences such as the order of the arguments. counts 
seem to me to correspond exactly to the Gecode count that takes an 
IntSet. [Admittedly I am not very good at reading such specifications, 
so maybe I missed some important point]

I understand that you might prefer short names, but I would say: a) 
adding an 's' does not really make the name much longer, and b) in the 
tutorial, the purpose of the text is probably not just to give a short 
specification, but to help the user understand the specific version of 
the constraint, and I personally feel longer names is appropriate here.

To me at least, it is difficult to pick out the specific variant with 
the right type, as I am not familiar with the gecode source for these 
constraints, and many of these constraints have the same name and number 
of arguments, differing only in the type of some of them, and to me at 
least, adding s for names of arrays (and possibly sets) would be a great 
help.

Cheers,

Kish
