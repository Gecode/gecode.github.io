OK

&gt;<i> Is your regexp related to a real example or did you want to torture Gecode
</I>&gt;<i> ;-)
</I>
I work on about 400 integer variables (about 15 months), and I have
regex that are applied on different intervals (year, semester, month,
week...).  To improve the performances, I would like to combine some
of the constraints on a unique DFA. So, the idea I had was generating
a regex that affect only a period but that have the length of my
problem:
  - first month : myReg + any(nbDaysIn14Month,nbDaysIn14Month)
  - second month : any(nbDaysIn1Month,nbDaysIn1Month) + myReg +
        any(nbDaysIn13Month,nbDaysIn13Month)
  - ...
  - first semester : ...
  - ...
and then I compute the intersection of the DFA.

&gt;<i> I never thought about operations on DFAs as I thought one would use regexps
</I>&gt;<i> anyway. The only hard part is in fact intersection, the rest is very simple.
</I>&gt;<i> What do you need them for?
</I>
Naive intersection is quite simple because we can easily generate a
DFA, and then, Gecode minimizes it.  But an effective implementation
may be difficult.

I use inverse (giving the alphabet) a lot because sometime it is
easier to write the regex of the forbidden pattern than the allowed
one.  As a simple example, I have this kind of forbidden pattern:
 0110 (on a subsequence of 4 variables) which is very simple to write
using the inverse:
  inverse(DFA(REG(0)+REG(1)+REG(1)+REG(0)), alphabet)
but much more difficult to write directly.

I have pattern rules of the type &quot;this pattern or that pattern&quot;. Here,
the union is useful, especially when one pattern is easier to write
with an inverse (else I can do REG r = firstPattern | secondPattern).

I can do what I have explain earlier using concatenation and
intersection of DFA (here, &quot;+&quot; is the concatenation of DFA):
  - first month: intersection(DFA(myReg), DFA(any(nbDaysIn1Month,
       nbDaysIn1Month))) + DFA(*any)
  - second month: DFA(any(nbDaysIn1Month,nbDaysIn1Month)) + 
        intersection(DFA(myReg,DFA(any(nbDaysIn1Month,nbDaysIn1Month)))) +
        DFA(*any)
  - ...

But maybe you have a better solution for the special problem I have
now: I have at least n_i &quot;1&quot; on each month_i, exactly m_j &quot;1&quot; on each
semester_j, and minimum one &quot;1&quot; on a slidding horizon of 7, and a
minimum of two &quot;1&quot; on a slidding horizon of 11.  The problem I have is
when there is a lot of possibilities for the first semester, but none
for the second (because of the 4 constraints, not because directly of
one of them), but the propagation do not detect the infeasibility of
the second semester. Of course, I cannot solve each semester
separatedly because there is pattern constraint that overlap.  For the
moment, I have a variable that &quot;count&quot; the &quot;1&quot; on each month, I use
rel to constraint these variables according to my data for the month
and the semester constraints, and I use sequence (in reality a count
for each interval of length 11, and an extensional for 1 on 7, which
is much faster than sequence) for the slidding constraints.  I also
have extensional version of these constraints.  The idea was to
combine the DFA to detect directly the infeasability.

I hope I am understandable.  Thanks for your attention.
