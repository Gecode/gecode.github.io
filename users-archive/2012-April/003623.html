<PRE>Guido,

Thanks for your suggested approach...it makes sense.  
I didn't know that branch could be called outside the model (i.e., in main).
But I'm wondering whether I'm looking at all the relevant documentation,
examples, ways of modeling using Gecode, etc.

I've been studying M&amp;PwG, consulting the online syntax documentation,
looking at the example code on the Gecode site, and searching this forum.
I get the feeling I have only 3 volumes of an encyclopedia, w/o the rest.
Are there other good sources of info, similar to the M&amp;PwG case studies,
that give some insight into the approaches people have found to use
Gecode to do common tasks well?  I'm not as interested in how it was built
as I am in how to use it well (I'm glad it's built well, but don't intend to 
build another, or extend it...I'm trying to use it). 

I started this thread with a question about an approach to using multiple
separate searches.  Christian helpfully indicated that this is a common 
technique.  Are there articles, papers, blog posts, forum entries where 
I can learn about common techniques to using Gecode, to use or build on 
what others have done?

(This isn't a complaint about the documentation...the docs explain their 
content very carefully and precisely.  I just wonder if anyone's 
documented elements of Gecode's usage too.)

Thanks,
-Milt
