<PRE>Hi,

I think there is an important aspect here: the kind of knowledge here is not
Gecode-specific but is really about how to use constraint programming in
general. And we have decided that material such as MPG focuses on what is
specific to Gecode, and rely on general constraint programming knowledge as
background.

So I think you are looking for general resources about constraint
programming. There are some textbooks, a Constraint journal, conferences,
and so on. I think I would look into this direction.

Cheers
Christian

Subject: Re: [gecode-users] Multiple separate searches

Guido,

Thanks for your suggested approach...it makes sense.  
I didn't know that branch could be called outside the model (i.e., in main).
But I'm wondering whether I'm looking at all the relevant documentation,
examples, ways of modeling using Gecode, etc.

I've been studying M&amp;PwG, consulting the online syntax documentation,
looking at the example code on the Gecode site, and searching this forum.
I get the feeling I have only 3 volumes of an encyclopedia, w/o the rest.
Are there other good sources of info, similar to the M&amp;PwG case studies,
that give some insight into the approaches people have found to use Gecode
to do common tasks well?  I'm not as interested in how it was built as I am
in how to use it well (I'm glad it's built well, but don't intend to build
another, or extend it...I'm trying to use it). 

I started this thread with a question about an approach to using multiple
separate searches.  Christian helpfully indicated that this is a common
technique.  Are there articles, papers, blog posts, forum entries where I
can learn about common techniques to using Gecode, to use or build on what
others have done?

(This isn't a complaint about the documentation...the docs explain their
content very carefully and precisely.  I just wonder if anyone's documented
elements of Gecode's usage too.)

Thanks,
-Milt
