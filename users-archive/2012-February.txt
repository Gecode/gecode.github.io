Hi Alexis,

 

Yep, I know ILOG CP reasonably well. But I have to admit it is really clear
what you are trying to achieve.

 

If you just want to solve goals that are a conjunction that corresponds to
posting the respective goals inside a space. 

 

As you say yourself, disjunctive goals corresponds to a choice generated by
a brancher. Posting a new brancher inside the commit function of some other
brancher is possible in fact. I am not really sure what you mean by the
return type, but let me try: posting a brancher does not fail. So what you
can do inside the commit function is to post a new brancher and return ES_OK
as ExecStatus (signalling that the commit indeed did not fail, a commit
could fail if it for example posted a new constraint).

 

I hope that helps somewhat.

 

Best

Christian

Hi all,

I'm currently studying the possibilty to migrate to Gecode a software
written with ILOG CP.
The actual model is computed dynamically using goals. I don't know if any of
you are a bit familiar with it, but if yes this is in essence what is done:
solver.solve (goal1 & goal2).
goal1 could be asking for the variable toto to be 0:
goal1-> toto=0
goal2 could be a combination of other goals:
goal2 -> goal3 || goal4 etc...(i mean goal4 could be another combination of
goals...).


I'm reading the very good tutorial "Modeling and Programming with Gecode",
actually i'm with the chapter 28 for implementing branchers.
It seems to me that for doing the equivalent of ILOG CP, i should have in a
space:
call branch1 (in order to replace goal1)
call branch2 (in order to replace goal2).

and implement the branch2 in order its choice have 2 alternatives
and doing  in branch2::commit something like { if a=0 return branch3 else
return branch4}.
The problem is that it doesn't seem to work like that since it claims an
ExecStatus type return.

Is it possible to create new branchers inside branchers so that the result
of the commit branch would call the commit of other branchers and so on ?

Thank you very much by advance for your support.

Best regards,
Alexis

Hi all,

After calling "status" is it possible to get a list of all the domain
values pruned, or even a list of all the variables who had their domains
pruned? I am able to iterate through all variables and compare their
domains, but this is of course, not very fast.

Thanks a lot,

Hi Matthew,

Gecode does not keep track of domain modifications on that level.  The first thing I'd try is whether iterating through the variables is really too expensive.  After all, checking whether the domain has changed is really cheap - just compare the domain sizes before and after (accessing them is constant time).

If iteration is prohibitively expensive, you have to implement a custom propagator that doesn't implement a constraint but simply "listens" to domain modifications.   It would be posted for all variables you're interested in, create advisors to be notified of modifications (so that it doesn't have to iterate), and simply record that information in an external data structure.  It doesn't ever have to be scheduled for propagation.  Our tutorial documentation should contain all the information to get you started.  Note that this approach also incurs an overhead, because each modification needs to be recorded somewhere, but that's just unavoidable.

Cheers,
Guido

Hi everybody,

i have to step into this discussion as i have similar demands ;)
I want to be notified whenever a boolean variable is assigned.
Currently i do this with a modified version of "wait". So i'm using a
propagator
that watches the boolean variable. It furthermore has a 4byte member
variable which
then says me which variable i do watch.
During propagation i then can add the changed variable to the list of
assigned variables.
I do not change the domain of anything.
Now my question:
Is it in this case more clever to use advisors? I do not need to
propagate, but as i'm not doing any propagation there should be no overhead.
Currently the performance of my systems suffers a bit because i have to
subscribe to every boolean variable.
Every propagator has a 4byte member. All this is copied during cloning
of a space, which happens quite often.
Can i avoid this using advisors?

Any idea how i can avoid copying the 4byte identifier of my propagator.
It is just used for the identification of which boolean variable i'm
subscribed to.
I do not need a copy of the propagator for each space.


Best,
Max

Hi,

 

Guido's idea is in fact the better one: what you pay for with wait is to
have one propagator for each Boolean variable which costs at least 24 bytes
plus 8 bytes for the function to be called on a 64 bit machine. Advisors are
in fact cheaper, they only cost 16 bytes. Also copying of advisors is in
fact much much faster: the trick is that how advisors are designed their
copying can in fact be inlined. This is not possible for a propagator such
as wait. Furthermore for Boolean variables it is even better as an advisor
subscribed to it will only be called when the variable is assigned, that is
at most once.

 

I wouldn't use a list for recording which variable has changed, check the
bit arrays that come with Gecode, they are very highly optimized (in
particular iterating over them uses special  instructions on most hardware).
And maybe it is even sufficient to record inside an advisor if it has
changed and later iterate over all advisors of the propagator to find which
variables have changed.

 

Christian

Thanks very much for your previous answers. They were very helpful.

I just wanted to have someone double check that I am using gecode
correctly. The goal is to assign every value-variable combination as a
preprocessing step, and collect data on the domain reduction on FlatZinc
instances.

Basically, I for every value, I am doing the following code for
variableIndex and valueIndex:

FlatZinc::FlatZincSpace* newProblem =(FlatZinc::FlatZincSpace*)(
problem->clone());
rel(*newProblem ,newProblem ->iv[variableIndex ],IRT_EQ,valueIndex,ICL_DEF);
newProblem->status();

My question is whether cloning the problem each time is the best course of
action? I am avoiding branching and choices, although I am not sure whether
cloning the problem is more expensive than creating branchers and choices,
and using them instead?

Thanks again,

Matthew

Hi Matthew,

 

Cloning is just fine and, in fact, even when using branchers, choices, etc
the necessary search would still use cloning. This issue is that you always
want to start from the same node (or state). Hence you will have to clone,
no matter what.

 

Best

Christian

Yes, the documentation is kind of misleading.  If glbAny (lubAny) returns true, it means that there was a lower bound (upper bound) change, but it cannot be represented by the delta.  For example, if you remove 0..3 from the upper bound, then lubAny()==false, lubMin()==0 and lubMax()==3.  But if you remove {0,3,5} from the upper bound, lubAny will be true, because the domain change cannot be represented exactly by the delta.

Guido

Message-ID: <20120207233234.290600@gmx.com>

Hello,

 I am new to gecode, and having played around with some of the examples I am blown away with how powerful it is. I realise this is a fairly old question so I'm sorry if this has recently been answered elsewhere, but I can't seem to find any answers which are not several years old. I would like to use floating point variables with gecode. I found floatvars over on google code, but their install instructions seemed to be for gecode 2.2 whereas I would like to continue using 3.7.1 if possible. I couldn't seem to get the same installation method to work, even when building from source with the --enable-float-vars flag. I also found Gecode::FlatZinc::AST::FloatVar and managed to get it to compile, but I couldn't do much with it. Also, it seems to require an integer in its constructor, is this just an identifier? I found several references in old threads to the Boost libraries, which I don't currently have installed. Is this required?

 I was wondering whether floating point variables has been implemented in gecode and, if not, what the best way to go about adding them is? Apparently I need it spelling out!
 I am on Mac OS X 10.6, using g++ version 4.2.1.

 Apologies again if this has already been answered.

 Kind regards,
 Sam

Hi Sam,

 

There is some progress on float vars in Gecode but they are not there yet (I know, too bad). With the next bigger release, Gecode 4.*, they will be part of the standard distribution.

However, to be honest Gecode 4.* is still some time away. Early summer at best.

 

Getting the older stuff to work with Gecode 3.7.1 seems to be not worth it. If you are feeling adventurous, you might talk to Vincent Barichard who is working on the float vars (cc'ed). 

 

Cheers

Christian

Subject: [gecode-users] FloatVar with Gecode 3.7.1

 

Hello,

I am new to gecode, and having played around with some of the examples I am blown away with how powerful it is. I realise this is a fairly old question so I'm sorry if this has recently been answered elsewhere, but I can't seem to find any answers which are not several years old. I would like to use floating point variables with gecode. I found floatvars over on google code, but their install instructions seemed to be for gecode 2.2 whereas I would like to continue using 3.7.1 if possible. I couldn't seem to get the same installation method to work, even when building from source with the --enable-float-vars flag. I also found Gecode::FlatZinc::AST::FloatVar and managed to get it to compile, but I couldn't do much with it. Also, it seems to require an integer in its constructor, is this just an identifier? I found several references in old threads to the Boost libraries, which I don't currently have installed. Is this required?

I was wondering whether floating point variables has been implemented in gecode and, if not, what the best way to go about adding them is? Apparently I need it spelling out!
I am on Mac OS X 10.6, using g++ version 4.2.1.

Apologies again if this has already been answered.

Kind regards,
Sam

Hi Christian,

Many thanks for the quick response. Yeah, too bad! If Vincent has any suggestions, I would be happy to hear them and try to get something going. Otherwise, am I best using something like quotients for now until 4.* hits the (metaphorical) shelves?

Best,
Sam

For whatever it's worth I'd like to note that I was able to build

--with-host-os=FreeBSD option. I am not sure why this is not

Hi Adam,

As I do not have access to a box running NetBSD, I offer you a deal: if you
test and confirm that the attached patch works for NetBSD, I'll add NetBSD
as a platform to Gecode for future releases.

Hi all,

Correct me i'm wrong but it seems that at the moment there is no way to
trace propagations events in Gecode...
Could you say me if it is planned for a next release or not ?
If no, could you indicate me how you do for knowing which constraint is
responsible for failure ?

Thanks a lot.

Alexis

Hi,

we have no plans to introduce tracing of the propagation at the moment, and there is no officially supported way to find out which propagator reported failure.  You'll have to have a look at the main propagation loop in the Gecode kernel and put in some debugging code there.  It's quite easy: look at Space::status in core.cpp, and add some output when the call to p->propagate() returns ES_FAILED.

The problem is that usually it is a conjunction of several constraints that, only together, cause the inconsistency, so just reporting one of them (the one that happened to report the inconsistency) is not very useful in general.  Furthermore, propagators in Gecode don't carry identifiers, so it is not so easy to map them back to the user-level model constraints.

Cheers,
Guido

They'd still return true, 1, and 0, respectively.  But you can use the function SetView::modevent(d) on your Delta d to find out which modification event caused the advisor to run.  For sets, the ModEvents contain enough information to find out which of the bounds has changed (except if you get ME_SET_VAL, unfortunately).
If you require more exact delta information, you could consider using CachedViews, which store the previous domain and make it easy to iterate over the difference.

Guido

Message-ID: <CAMez7+cHMuQbOV=W+FO1dYjBU8jy87ejTO_EVy4urAhUCemKNw@mail.gmail.com>

Hi,

I am one of the beginner users of CP and Gecode.

I am doing a problem model on allocation, binding and scheduling and the
closest example I could find on Gecode is the open-shop scheduling problem.
I was hoping that you could guide me to a better example that also involves
binding (assigning tasks to resources) in addition to scheduling just to
get an idea. I have been trying hard but have not managed to do the binding
in parallel with scheduling so far.

Thank you in advance.

Best regards,
Wajid

I have been trying hard but have not managed to do the binding in parallel with scheduling so far.

There is no direct support for this in Gecode.  You could try to introduce, for each task, an optional task on each resource, and then put a constraint on the BoolVars that represent the optionality so that exactly one of them must be active.  The problem is that Gecode doesn't have built-in search heuristics for this kind of problem, and you probably need a special heuristic to solve anything of interesting size.

Hi,

I am a beginner user working on finding an optimal solution for a binding,
scheduling and routing problem. I have done the binding and scheduling
part, and now have some questions regarding the routing dependencies, i.e.,
if they can be expressed in gecode or not. This might be something trivial,
but I haven't figured it out yet.

I run the Gecode model and find the appropriate binding (decision of which
task should be assigned to which resource), this is stored in an
IntVarArray _binding.

The routing part depends on the binding, i.e., it considers two tasks T1
and T2, and as per the application, lets say that the output of T1 needs to
go to the input of T2. To assign the data coming out of T1 to an
appropriate link on the network so that it reaches T2, we need to know the
resources to which T1 and T2 were bound. As I stated above, this
information is itself found out by the Gecode model and stored in an
IntVarArray _binding.

Now, I cannot figure out a way to check the value of an IntVarArray
_binding and use it to constrain another IntVarArray. A naive approach is
the if else, which cannot be applied on a constraint variable since it has
not been assigned a value yet. Any suggestions would be highly appreciated.

Hi everybody,

after years I am back to implement a CSP with Gecode and would like to 
get your feedback on the best way how to handle the encoding.

My problem has integer tuples (i,j) as values for its variables while i 
and j are bound by an interval [1,n], ie. (i,j) \in (n x n), and n 
usually < 200.

There has been much change in the Gecode library since I used it. Is 
there already a way to directly use tuples as values or do I have to 
encode them via integers?

If not, do you see a better/faster way of encoding than doing
   v = i*(n+1) + j
such that I get i=(v/(n+1)) and j=(v%(n+1))?

If yes, do you expect a large performance difference between using 
tuples or encode/decode integers? I will only need a global "distinct" 
constraint, some binary order constraints and some instances of a 
selfwritten binary constraint.

Thanks for your feedback!

Yours,
Martin

Hi Martin,

Gecode does not have tuples so you would have to represent this by two
variables. However, this representation is rather weak (you might want to
read Tip 6.3 in MPG what the issue is) as one can only express information
about each component in the tuple individually but not information about
tuples (that is, ruling out certain combinations of values).

Then there is even a hand-optimized propagator for the constraint you are
talking about (it is used for matrix element constraints) but unfortunately
the constraint is not directly available in a Gecode model. If you look at
the file gecode/int/element.cpp and search "pair" you will see what I mean.
Maybe I should make the constraint available in general. What do you say?

Cheers
Christian

Hi Christian,

thanks for the quick response!

The Pair constraint looks quite useful for me. It can be used to post an 
order on the tuples, a distinct constraint etc. But so far I am not sure 
if there are many applications where you can use it on its own.
Thus, I am not sure if you want/have to make it generally available.

Concerning my tuple problem and your suggestion to use two variables per 
tuple-variable:

Maybe a mini description of the problem itself: it is a variant of the 
subgraph-matching problem where I want to find a very constraint 
subgraph of k nodes in two graphs (each with n (>>k) nodes) 
simultatiously, to get a mapping from one graph into the other. This is 
where the tuples come from, i is from the first graph, j from the second.

I am unsure if to use the pair of variables or a direct (hard coded) 
encoding using half the variables.

The reason is, I can rule out most (many) of the tuples when 
initializing the CSP domains, ie. many node combinations are not 
allowed. Thus, I could create a set of all plausible tuples and use it 
as the initial domains of my variables.

If I go for the two-variable-model with 2*k variables with domains 
[1,n], I would have to post additional (cheap) constraints plus 2*n 
additional helper variables (with small domains) in order to rule out 
all non-plausible node mappings, ie. tuples.
Not sure if the additional propagation needed will compensate for the 
more low level encoding. :/
Furthermore, I am not sure if the two variable encoding is as expressive 
as a single tuple-encoding variable version, since the latter allows for 
more specific tuple set encodings. E.g. {(1,2),(2,1)} versus 
{1,2}x{1,2}={(1,1),(1,2),(2,1),(2,2)}.

Mhh... most likely I have to try both in order to find out.. :(

If you have further suggestions or comments, please let me know. And 
thanks for your thoughts!

So long,
Martin

As you say, you might have to try ;-) I think I'll make pair available for
the next release (it doesn't really hurt).

Thank you Mauricio. This seems to be it, I will try it and see if it works
for me.

Hi Christian,

The problem in a nut shell is:

I have two arrays of integer variables, Array1[x] and Array2[x]. I want to
use the value assigned to the variables in Array1[] as an index of
Array2[], something like this:

rel(*this, Array2[Array1[x].val()] + (something) <= Array2[x+1]);

Is there anything wrong with the above constraint or should this work?

Best regards,
Wajid

That is what the element constraint is used for (you'll find it in the documentation).  It works directly on variables, so you don't have to solve the sub-problem on x first.

Hi Guido,

Thank you for the reply.

*// That is what the element constraint is used for (you'll find it in the
documentation).  It works directly on variables, so you don't have to solve
the sub-problem on x first.*

I am not sure I follow your point. Let me clarify the question, there are
two integer variable arrays Array1[] and Array2[]. Both the arrays are
constrained in different ways individually. Then, as a last constraint
Array1[] needs to be constrained using the values assigned to Array2[]. So,
do u think the following constraint would work or not?

rel(*this, Array2[Array1[some_index].val()] + (something) <=
Array2[another_index]);


It doesn't give any errors on compilation but I haven't finished the rest
of the model yet to be 100% sure if it works correctly or not.

Thank you in advance.

Best regards,
Wajid

No, that's not how it works, because when you model your problem, the value of Array1[some_index].val() is not yet known (an exception will be thrown at runtime).  

It also depends a lot on whether some_index and another_index are IntVars or simple int constants.  If they are simple ints, the following may work:
rel(*this, element(Array2, Array1[some_index]+(something)) <= Array2[another_index]));
If they are IntVars, you need to decompose some more using element.  Please read the documentation on element constraints, that should clarify things.

Cheers,
Guido

No, it does not have it: 3.7.2 is a bug-fix only release (the print-last
thing is a big thing as we rewrote the argument handling completely, that's
why it did not qualify).

Hi,

 

Has the new release 3.7.2 for Windows got this as well? I looked and could
not find it here http://www.gecode.org/doc-latest/reference/PageChange.html

Hi,

I added the command line switch -print-last to the trunk. In case you build
Gecode yourself from source you can use the attached patch to get the
behaviour.

Yes, such an option would be great :).

Thanks again for your time!
