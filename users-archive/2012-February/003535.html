<PRE>Hi,

 

Guido's idea is in fact the better one: what you pay for with wait is to
have one propagator for each Boolean variable which costs at least 24 bytes
plus 8 bytes for the function to be called on a 64 bit machine. Advisors are
in fact cheaper, they only cost 16 bytes. Also copying of advisors is in
fact much much faster: the trick is that how advisors are designed their
copying can in fact be inlined. This is not possible for a propagator such
as wait. Furthermore for Boolean variables it is even better as an advisor
subscribed to it will only be called when the variable is assigned, that is
at most once.

 

I wouldn't use a list for recording which variable has changed, check the
bit arrays that come with Gecode, they are very highly optimized (in
particular iterating over them uses special  instructions on most hardware).
And maybe it is even sufficient to record inside an advisor if it has
changed and later iterate over all advisors of the propagator to find which
variables have changed.

Subject: Re: [gecode-users] List of pruned values

 

Hi everybody,

i have to step into this discussion as i have similar demands ;)
I want to be notified whenever a boolean variable is assigned.
Currently i do this with a modified version of &quot;wait&quot;. So i'm using a
propagator
that watches the boolean variable. It furthermore has a 4byte member
variable which
then says me which variable i do watch.
During propagation i then can add the changed variable to the list of
assigned variables.
I do not change the domain of anything.
Now my question:
Is it in this case more clever to use advisors? I do not need to propagate,
but as i'm not doing any propagation there should be no overhead.
Currently the performance of my systems suffers a bit because i have to
subscribe to every boolean variable.
Every propagator has a 4byte member. All this is copied during cloning of a
space, which happens quite often.
Can i avoid this using advisors?

Any idea how i can avoid copying the 4byte identifier of my propagator.
It is just used for the identification of which boolean variable i'm
subscribed to.
I do not need a copy of the propagator for each space.


Best,
Max

Hi Matthew, 

 

Gecode does not keep track of domain modifications on that level.  The first
thing I'd try is whether iterating through the variables is really too
expensive.  After all, checking whether the domain has changed is really
cheap - just compare the domain sizes before and after (accessing them is
constant time).

 

If iteration is prohibitively expensive, you have to implement a custom
propagator that doesn't implement a constraint but simply &quot;listens&quot; to
domain modifications.   It would be posted for all variables you're
interested in, create advisors to be notified of modifications (so that it
doesn't have to iterate), and simply record that information in an external
data structure.  It doesn't ever have to be scheduled for propagation.  Our
tutorial documentation should contain all the information to get you
started.  Note that this approach also incurs an overhead, because each
modification needs to be recorded somewhere, but that's just unavoidable.

 

Cheers,

Guido

Hi all,

After calling &quot;status&quot; is it possible to get a list of all the domain values
pruned, or even a list of all the variables who had their domains pruned? I
am able to iterate through all variables and compare their domains, but this
is of course, not very fast.

Thanks a lot, 

Matthew
