<PRE>Hi Sam,

 

There is some progress on float vars in Gecode but they are not there yet (I know, too bad). With the next bigger release, Gecode 4.*, they will be part of the standard distribution.

However, to be honest Gecode 4.* is still some time away. Early summer at best.

 

Getting the older stuff to work with Gecode 3.7.1 seems to be not worth it. If you are feeling adventurous, you might talk to Vincent Barichard who is working on the float vars (cc'ed). 

 

Cheers

Christian

Subject: [gecode-users] FloatVar with Gecode 3.7.1

 

Hello,

I am new to gecode, and having played around with some of the examples I am blown away with how powerful it is. I realise this is a fairly old question so I'm sorry if this has recently been answered elsewhere, but I can't seem to find any answers which are not several years old. I would like to use floating point variables with gecode. I found floatvars over on google code, but their install instructions seemed to be for gecode 2.2 whereas I would like to continue using 3.7.1 if possible. I couldn't seem to get the same installation method to work, even when building from source with the --enable-float-vars flag. I also found Gecode::FlatZinc::AST::FloatVar and managed to get it to compile, but I couldn't do much with it. Also, it seems to require an integer in its constructor, is this just an identifier? I found several references in old threads to the Boost libraries, which I don't currently have installed. Is this required?

I was wondering whether floating point variables has been implemented in gecode and, if not, what the best way to go about adding them is? Apparently I need it spelling out!
I am on Mac OS X 10.6, using g++ version 4.2.1.

Apologies again if this has already been answered.

Kind regards,
Sam
