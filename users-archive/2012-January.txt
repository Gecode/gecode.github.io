Hi,

I am trying to run Gecode for the first time. If I want to use the VS 2008
IDE, the guide "Modeling and Programing with Gecode" states on pg. 19 that
all necessary settings can be configured in the properties dialog of the
solution. Can any one please help me in doing the following:

* You must use dynamic linking against a mutithreaded library. That is,
either /MD or /MDd. Depending on which one is used, corresponding libraries
and DLLs will be used automatically. *(How do I do this? Using command line
or can it be set in the properties dialog of the solution?*)

* You have to enable /EHsc option *(How?)*

* You have to switch off assertions by defining /DNDEBUG *(where do I do
that?)*

Thanks.

Hi,

 

I think you might profit from re-reading the whole of Section 2.3.1. There
is in fact a complete example using the command line with all options.

 

For the MSVC IDE, please consult Microsofts documentation, this is hardly a
Gecode matter.

 

Best

Christian

Hi Christian,

Thank you for the answer.

For now, I am able to run Gecode examples on VS 2008 without doing those 3
steps that I mentioned. I am not certain of how vital these steps are when
one is using the IDE ('Modeling and Programming with Gecode' asks one to do
those on Pg. 19) but I will just skip them for now as everything seems to
be working. Thanks again.

Hi,
  I am trying to make some minor changes to the flatzinc to gecode

autolinking tries to link to flatzinc library as well).  If there a
particular way to turn off the autolinking. I built the gecode source

Hi,

 

The auto-linking is controlled by which headers your programs include. So as
long as your program include <gecode/flatzinc.hh> the corresponding DLL will
be picked up for linking.

 

But I do not really understand what you mean by building fz.exe as
standalone: it requires the flatzinc DLL and you can't build fz.exe without
it.

 

Disabling auto linking is quite tricky as it is an all-or-nothing thing:
switching off autolinking would require that you manually link against all
the other Gecode DLLs.

 

Cheers

Christian

Subject: [gecode-users] MinimizeScript: Beginners Question
Message-ID: <4F154A7E.6020101@zapster.cc>

Hello,

I am currently modelling my first optimisation problem using Gecode.
Apparently MinimizeScript (as well as MinimizeSpace) consider all
solutions, not only the one with the minimal cost() value.
As far as I understood it, the constraint(Space&) method is used to add
restrictions so that the next solution is better than the current. That
means that the last solution must be the optimal solution.
If I want to find all optimal solutions I have to change constrain form
cost_value < old.cost() to something like cost_value <= old.cost(). Are
these assumptions correct?
Now the real question. Is it possible to configure MinimizeScript in a
way that it only prints the very last (optimal) solution?
Is it possible that the commandline option -solutions is used in respect
to optimal solutions s.t. -solutions 0 means "print all optimal
solution", -solutions 1 "print the first optimal solution" and so on.

I am sorry if the answer to my questions is obvious but I didn't manage
to find it in the docs or mailing list.

Thanks for making such a great piece of software and for keeping it
available for everyone!

Hi,

Please let me take your questions in turn.

1. Changing the relation from strict (that is, "<") to a non-strict (that
is, "<=") will typically not work. It would entail that you do not only find
all _optimal_ solutions but all solution for each and every cost value! So
normally that will be way too many solutions! Try it out with Gist on a
small example and you will see that this will make things break down.

Should I add a tip in MPG that the order must be strict for things to work?

2. To find all optimal solutions, I would first find _one_ optimal solution
as normal. Then I would find all solutions (starting a new search) where the
cost value is equal to the optimal const value.

3. You see that printing "all" optimal solutions with respect to 1. and 2.
does not really make much sense.

I hope that helps

Best
Christian

Ups, my bad. Clearly adding a non strict constraint does not make much
sense.

> Should I add a tip in MPG that the order must be strict for things to work?

Maybe, but I my eyes it is more confusing that
MinimizeSpace/MinimizeScript return non-optimal solutions, at least for
a new user. Some other things about MPG and optimization that are not
straight forward in my opinion:

1. Information is spread over several chapters:
   - 2.5 Best solution search
   - 3.2 Using a cost function
   - 6.3 Support for cost-based optimization
   - 7.4 Search engines

2. Best Solution Search engine
It is mentioned in 2.5 and 7.4 but not 3.2 and 6.3 and there are no
links to the other sections. Maybe it should be stated more clearly that
BAB or Restart must be used for best solution search.

3. constrain()
In 2.5: "Note that every space defines a default constrain() member
function (to keep the design of models simple). If a model does not
re-define the constrain() member function, the default function will be
called which throws an exception of type SpaceConstrainUndefined (as
this is a modeling error)".
In my eyes the second sentence is not true as OptimizeSpace provides a
valid constrain().

These are rather beginner problems than problems of MPG. Gecode is one
of the best documented free software I've seen. I just want to share my
experience.

I see. That makes sense.

Ok using -solutions for optimal solutions does not work. But how about
printing only the last (optimal if -solutions 0) solution with
MinimizeScript?

Hi Josef,

Thanks for your observations as far as MPG is concerned. I'll think them
through and look how to improve. The information being spread out can't
really be helped much as each location takes a different angle and different
depth. But I promise I'll think...

Then printing each solution is actually what you want (I guess): normally,
finding a best solution takes so long that you will have to settle for the
solution that has been found last after the time is up. But maybe there
could be an additional switch which would only make sense in a best solution
search scenario: -print-last where only the last solution found is printed,
and if a time out is encountered then also the last and not necessarily best
solution is printed. Would that make you happy?

Christian

I would also be happy with something like this!
Currently doing optimisation search and wanting to print the solution in a  
file results in a really big file of which you only need the last part.

Yes, such an option would be great :).

Hi,

I added the command line switch -print-last to the trunk. In case you build
Gecode yourself from source you can use the attached patch to get the
behaviour.

Hi Mark,

it seems that you refer to my model
    http://hakank.org/gecode/killer_sudoku.cpp
since it has these three cells missing, which just was an oversight.

It's fixed now in this model. Thanks for letting me know.

Subject: [gecode-users] Space val method causes python to crash
Message-ID: <jg30tq$s3o$1@dough.gmane.org>

Hi all,

The subject is easy enough to reproduce, FWIW I'm on Windows Vista.

c:\Users\Mark\Python>python -V
Python 2.7.1

c:\Users\Mark\Python>type a.py
from gecode import *
s = space()
cell = s.intvar(1, 9)
print s.assigned(cell)
s.val(cell)
c:\Users\Mark\Python>python a.py
False

This application has requested the Runtime to terminate it in an unusual 
way.
Please contact the application's support team for more information.

Have I misunderstood the way that val is called and/or used or is this a 
genuine problem?

-- 
Cheers.

Mark Lawrence.

val() raises an exception if applied to a not yet assigned variable (the
variable in you example still has domain 1...9), please check the docs.

Subject: [gecode-users] dynamic model
Message-ID: <CANBFYtaAxxegnn4GgmHJJuLoBhXRg3Jke5bZgcj_7aZ+M1E+sw@mail.gmail.com>

Hi all,

I'm currently studying the possibilty to migrate to Gecode a software
written with ILOG CP.
The actual model is computed dynamically using goals. I don't know if any
of you are a bit familiar with it, but if yes this is in essence what is
done:
solver.solve (goal1 & goal2).
goal1 could be asking for the variable toto to be 0:
goal1-> toto=0
goal2 could be a combination of other goals:
goal2 -> goal3 || goal4 etc...(i mean goal4 could be another combination of
goals...).


I'm reading the very good tutorial "Modeling and Programming with Gecode",
actually i'm with the chapter 28 for implementing branchers.
It seems to me that for doing the equivalent of ILOG CP, i should have in a
space:
call branch1 (in order to replace goal1)
call branch2 (in order to replace goal2).

and implement the branch2 in order its choice have 2 alternatives
and doing  in branch2::commit something like { if a=0 return branch3 else
return branch4}.
The problem is that it doesn't seem to work like that since it claims an
ExecStatus type return.

Is it possible to create new branchers inside branchers so that the result
of the commit branch would call the commit of other branchers and so on ?

Thank you very much by advance for your support.

Best regards,
Alexis
