Hi,

I suspect the answer to the following question should be somewhere in 
the MPG document, but I was unable to find it - apologies if this is the 
case.

I am interested on obtaining the number of clones for a specific example 
when subject to different value for the c_d parameter in the context of 
a DFS search. I believe gecode used to report this value in the 
statistics, but now it seems there is a specific class CloneStatistics 
which should be updated as search proceeds. I fail to see how to pass an 
object of type CloneStatistics to the DFS search object. Also the 
Space::clone() member function (which seems to be the only place where 
this object can be updated) is not virtual, and therefore cannot be 
intercepted in my subclass of Space (is this correct?). So I tried 
another approach, which was simply to count the number of times that my 
copy() function gets called, which I thought should tell me the number 
of clones. Now I think I'm wrong since this number always reports the 
same number of clones for different values of c_d.

Obviously I'm making some mistake. Any hints?

Thanks!

Hi Marco,

Well, the number of clones _is_ the same for any value of c-d or a-d! You
have to backtrack, so you have to make a clone! The difference is that you
clone different spaces.

Hi Christian,

Thanks for the reply, I think I got it. I was under the impression that 
recomputation (and adaptive recomputation) where techniques for 
optimizing runtime performance when compared with standard copy since 
recomputing could perhaps be faster than copying for some cases. But now 
I see I was wrong and that their purpose is only to save space. This 
means that setting c_d=1  should always provide faster runtime than any 
other method (assuming that the problem at hand does not require huge 
amounts of memory). Am I getting the right picture now, or am I 
oversimplifying?

Thanks!

Hi,

Is there any plan in near future to add support arbitary
precision arithmetic (using GNU GMP or some other library)?

Please let me know!

Thank you,

You may in fact save runtime in case you don't explore the entire tree.  E.g. when you're only searching for one solution (not optimising), many branches may remain unexplored.  With a higher c_d, you will have fewer clones than choice points, and in some cases (deep trees) search will also be faster.

Cheers,
Guido

I see. So the runtime gain due to setting c_d>1 with DFS should only 
come from the set of clones avoided along the rightmost path (i.e. the 
path from the search tree root to the solution). I'm thinking that all 
the subtrees to the left of the rightmost path were fully explored and 
therefore setting c_d>1 there should not provide any speedup there.  Is 
this correct?

Thanks

No, not really. Even though it would be very simple, just following the
design of variables with bounds only shown in Part V of MPG.

Hello,

         I got a problem about extensional(regular) constraint. The question is whether the input of a regular constraint can be a NFA.
         In the detailed description file of DFA ( http://www.gecode.org/doc-latest/reference/classGecode_1_1DFA.html ), it is said that "the transitions must be deterministic." Is is true? I applied regular constraint on some NFA constraint, it seems to be able to give the correct result. 

Thank a lot!

The implementation uses optimizations that only work for DFAs. You just have
been lucky with your particular NFA.

Thanks for your reply, but what is the "optimizations" in the implementation, part of code in the file "layered-graph.hpp" ?
 Could you help to point out which part in the code that leads NFA not work?

Message-ID: <CAAgdDW38=nYOgrNEWR+KBPGyCGVMZ+hyie2cBgcSeD7Pb_utyQ@mail.gmail.com>

Hello,

I've been trying to implement this LNS engine. The idea is that once a
solution is found, some part of this solution is destroyed to be
re-inserted in some different way. I don't really understand how this can
be done though. Currently I build a completely new model constraining the
variables that are not destroyed to take the values they had in the
previous solution. Is there some better way to "unassign" a variable though?

Many thanks,
Joan

Hi Joan,

 

Your decision is absolutely right: the idea to remove (or undo) parts of a
solution is not feasible (this is a very difficult problem as would have to
undo all propagation, search, etc). Starting from scratch is the right idea.

 

There you have two possibilities: either you re-create the model completely
or you try to keep one master copy of your model and then creates clones
from it (I guess you have read how to implement search in Gecode). The
latter one is more efficient. You can also mix both approaches in that you
keep part of your model that is common to all searches in LNS as a master
space and for each new try you create a clone of the master space and then
add those constraints to it (by some member function you can implement) that
are specific to the current try.

 

Does this make sense?

Christian

Dear Sir,
I am using Gecode for my university project work for solving optimization
problem.My main objective is a TSP problem.The cost matrix optimization is
done by Gecode.I am using the procedure that you used in the example TSP.
but my problem is that, I am calling the TSP procedures inside of a
another function,looks like here: void call_tsp(void){
                           TsPOptions opt(...);
                           opt.solutions(0);
                           opt.icl(ICL_DOM);
                           MinimizeScript::run<TsP,BAB,TsPOptions>(opt);
                                          }
and now I want to get the value of the Intvar total object that is defined
in TSP.cpp as an integer.As the why the script method execute the TSP code
it is rather imposible to acces this value inside the function.I treid
something like int a=total.val(); but it will throug an exception.

I would rather appreciate if you could help me.

Thank you very much,

Hi,

The ::run function is just a special case for using the search engines that
come with Gecode and only print solutions. If you want to use search engines
directly to get access to solutions rather than just printing them, please
consult Chapter 2 in Modeling and Programming with Gecode on how to use
search engines and later Chpater 7.

Message-ID: <4FED7F05.4020804@cs.uni-potsdam.de>

I have a problem with my software clingcon, that uses gecode.

This piece of software is an SMT solver, that uses gecode as a theory
solver.
But i can also use it as a solver for arithmetic, without any SAT component.

Now my question: Is the behavior of Gecode reproducible.
Whenever i start my program with exactly the same parameters, i do get
the same result (same gecode statistics).
When i change a parameter (like not printing the solution) i do get a
different result (in terms of fails, nodes, etc... ).

The parameter i change should not affect Gecode at all (everything
related to gecode is done with exactly the same input and in the same
order).
So do you use some memory position for hashing or some random generator
initialized according to some position in memory or something else that
explains this behavior.

Currently i get between 3 and 8615650 fails for a simple LatinSquare
program, just because i change output formatting.


PS:
I tried this with gecode 3.5, 3.7 and trunk.
I also tested the whole program with "valgrind --leak-check=full" and
nothing uninitialized was used or lost.


Any ideas?

Best,
Max

Hi,

there are three features in Gecode that can result in nondeterministic behaviour: parallel search, search strategies based on AFC, and nonmonotonic propagators (currently circuit and nvalues).  If you don't use these features, the search trees will be exactly the same between runs (even for randomised strategies, as long as you don't change the random seed).  

Cheers,
Guido

It was indeed my mistake (as usual).
I make my branching array unique by some stl algorithms.
unfortuantely, i forgot that IntVar::before and IntVar::same rely on the
pointer position,
so use of these function can make your program non-deterministic.

Best and thanks for all (and sorry for bugging),
Max



Code:
std::sort(iva_.begin(), iva_.end(), boost::bind(&IntVar::before,_1,_2));
IntVarArgs::iterator newEnd = std::unique(iva_.begin(), iva_.end(),
boost::bind(&IntVar::same,_1,_2));
