<PRE>Actually there is one other approach: Just branch on a and b but not c and d
(by posting an appropriate brancher). Then when you give this to a search
engine you, say e1, you would get a space, say s1, from e1 where only a and
b are assigned. Then, you could post a new branching in s1 where you branch
on c and d. Then you could use a search engine on s1 to give you a solution
where also c and d are assigned. Then, you could request a solution from e1
again where the next assignment for a and b is produced.

You can do this in different ways, it depends on how you can detect the
situation.  The easiest solution is by simply adding constraints that remove
the extra solutions.  This is basically static symmetry breaking.  E.g., you
could add a constraint (a=00 &amp;&amp; b==0) &gt;&gt; (c==0 &amp;&amp; d==0), which removes all
other solutions for c and d.
If you can't add those constraints statically, you have to write your own
brancher that can detect this situation and fix the remaining variables
accordingly (which is similar to &quot;symmetry breaking during search&quot;).
Perhaps you'll get some ideas by looking into the symmetry breaking
literature.

Cheers,
Guido
