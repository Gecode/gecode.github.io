Hi,

we currently don't have plans to include that algorithm in the next release.

Cheers,
Guido

Subject: [gecode-users] Extending the flatzinc interface
Message-ID: <4FA7B8E6.5090602@it.uu.se>

Hello,

I would like to extend the Gecode/Flatzinc interface to handle 
"natively" more constraints (that I implemented in Gecode). The way I do 
it is to add new constraints to the Registry global object. So my code 
looks like:

#include <gecode/flatzinc.hh>
#include <gecode/flatzinc/registry.hh>
#include "my_cstr_prop.hh"

namespace Gecode { namespace FlatZinc {

void p_my_cstr(FlatZincSpace& s, const ConExpr& ce, AST::Node* ann) {
       IntVar x = getIntVar(s, ce[0]);
       IntVar y = getIntVar(s, ce[1]);
       My_CSTR(s,x,y,ann2icl(ann));
     }

class MyPoster {
    public:
    MyPoster(void) {
        registry().add("my_cstr", &p_my_cstr);
    }
};
MyPoster __my_poster;
}}

This is done by "monkey-see-monkey-do" from the file registry.cpp. 
However, I ran into several problems. First, I had to add the definition 
of "getIntVar" and "ann2icl", that I just copy-pasted from registry.cpp 
(as they are not declared in a header file, and furthermore are in an 
anonymous namespace). So, my question is to know if this is the way I'm 
suppose to do it, or if there is a more straightforward way to extend 
the Gecode/Flatzinc interface with new constraints.


Second (this might be more related to c++ rather than Gecode, apologizes 
if this is indeed the case), I've been unable to link the resulting 
object file against libgecodeflatzinc.so with the following command 
(fz.o is the object file from fz.cpp in the gecode distrib):

g++   ./src_c/fz.o ./src_c/my_cstr.o   -lgecodeflatzinc -lgecodedriver 
-lgecodesearch -lgecodeminimodel -lgecodeset -lgecodeint -lgecodekernel 
-lgecodesupport

It yields the following error:

./src_c/my_cstr.o: In function `global constructors keyed to 
_Z3NEQN6Gecode4HomeENS_6IntVarES1_NS_11IntConLevelE':
my_cstr.cpp:(.text+0x2667): undefined reference to 
`Gecode::FlatZinc::registry()'
my_cstr.cpp:(.text+0x2679): undefined reference to 
`Gecode::FlatZinc::Registry::add(std::basic_string<char, 
std::char_traits<char>, std::allocator<char> > const&, void 
(*)(Gecode::FlatZinc::FlatZincSpace&, Gecode::FlatZinc::ConExpr const&, 
Gecode::FlatZinc::AST::Node*))'

However, I'm able to link the same object file against the object files 
that are compiled into libgecodeflatzinc:

g++  ./src_c/fz.o ./src_c/my_cstr.o  gecode-3.7.3/gecode/flatzinc/*.o 
-lgecodedriver -lgecodesearch -lgecodeminimodel -lgecodeset -lgecodeint 
-lgecodekernel -lgecodesupport

So, I'm wondering why and how this is happening, and I have no clue... 
(I'm using Gecode 3.7.1, compiler is gcc 4.5.2, on Ubuntu 11.04)

Thank you very much for your help,

Jean-No?l Monette

Hi,

you are running into these problems because I didn't really take care that the registry can be extended by users - sorry about that.  I'll put the helper functions in a header so you can include them.  The linker problems are due to missing export declarations.  You can probably work around that problem by compiling Gecode with the --disable-gcc-visibility configure switch.  I'll also fix that.

Cheers,
Guido

Hello all,

As I would like to make a 32bit framework linked with gecode, I was wondering :
How painful would it be to build the last version of gecode as a "universal binary" Framework ?

Thanks for any advice,

Serge

Hi Serge,
it's not painful at all, it's just that the Qt binary package is now 64 bit only, so for a universal binary package of Gecode we'd have to build Qt ourselves, too.

To build a universal binary framework without Qt, simply use the following options for configure:
--disable-qt --with-architectures=i386,x86_64 --enable-framework

Cheers,
Guido

Subject: [gecode-users] Output control for the Script class
Message-ID: <CALtg6jnPXrARmQtK-6e=Osbwep9-ky79MA=ArAcyOo5Og5MzRw@mail.gmail.com>

Hi,

I'am using Gecode for a project at work (I'am using Script class) and I
needed to separate Gecode message (timing, statistics etc..) from
solutions. That's because solutions "goes out" in a certain format that
another process have to decode, so I cannot mix solutions with Gecode
message.

The simplest solution I found was to change cout to clog everywhere in
ScriptBase::run, everywhere BUT when calling ex->print() which print the
solution. This is enough to have Gecode messages to standard log and
solutions to standard output, and now I can redirect them separately.

I would like to have this kind behavior on future releases of
Gecode. Flatzinc has already some options that do something like that (-s
and -o, I think), I want to implement something similar and send some
patches if you agree (it's pretty simple from what I see).
Tell me what you think about it.

Cheers.

Hi Andrea,

 

If you send me the patches, I can have a look. I am not that sure because
there is always the option to not use the driver but use a search engine
directly.

Hello all,

I am currently trying to develop a LNS application in Gecode, and I've read
in the mailing list that as of 14/10/2011 Gecode 4.0.0 was being prepared,
which will include further support on LNS.
I would like to ask whether it would be possible to somehow access these
developments regarding LNS or get a partial release, or we must definitely
wait for the full release.

Thanks a lot,

You would have to wait for the full release, LNS support is not in there
yet.

 

Doing LNS by yourself is not that hard, though. Maybe you could have a look
in Modeling and Programming with Gecode on how to implement search engines.
You will see that this is pretty easy to pull off. If you have particular
questions, you can always ask.

 

Best

Christian

I am currently trying to develop a LNS application in Gecode, and I've read
in the mailing list that as of 14/10/2011 Gecode 4.0.0 was being prepared,
which will include further support on LNS. 
I would like to ask whether it would be possible to somehow access these
developments regarding LNS or get a partial release, or we must definitely
wait for the full release. 

Thanks a lot,
Joan

Hello,

Many thanks for your quick answer. Looking at how to implement my own
search engine is what I've been doing for the last week, looks like I'm
finally getting it. Anyway I figured out it might have come handy if
something was available now, so that's why I asked.

Thanks again,
Joan
