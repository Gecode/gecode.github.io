<PRE>You would have to wait for the full release, LNS support is not in there
yet.

 

Doing LNS by yourself is not that hard, though. Maybe you could have a look
in Modeling and Programming with Gecode on how to implement search engines.
You will see that this is pretty easy to pull off. If you have particular
questions, you can always ask.

 

Best

Christian

Subject: [gecode-users] Large neighborhood search support

 

Hello all,

I am currently trying to develop a LNS application in Gecode, and I've read
in the mailing list that as of 14/10/2011 Gecode 4.0.0 was being prepared,
which will include further support on LNS. 
I would like to ask whether it would be possible to somehow access these
developments regarding LNS or get a partial release, or we must definitely
wait for the full release. 

Thanks a lot,
Joan
