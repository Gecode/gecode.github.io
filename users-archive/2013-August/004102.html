<PRE>Hi Christian,

Thanks for your reply!

</I>
I don't mind changing the existing code more extensively, but I think I 
probably would need to have a pointer to a 'search engine' thingy 
(currently I have a class -- GecodeSearch for this, sengine is not 
visible outside the class), which I can set to the appropriate search or 
meta- search engine, and for which I can call a next() function to get 
the next solution. Can this be done?


&gt;<i> Having said that, the stuff you are doing might work and I have an idea

</I>&gt;<i> (so sengine0 in your example). That means you are not allowed to delete it
</I>&gt;<i> yourself in your code. But as said, just an idea.
</I>
I actually do not delete sengine0 already, i.e. in ~GecodeSearch, I only 
delete sengine. This was because deleting segine0 crashed.

Cheers,

Kish

</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Subject: [gecode-users] Adding restart-based search to ECLiPSe's interface
</I>&gt;<i> to
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Gecode
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Hi,
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> I am still trying to figure out how to add restart based search to
</I>&gt;<i> ECLiPSe's
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> interface to Gecode. I tried modifying my existing code (which does not
</I>&gt;<i> support
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> restart-based search), and managed to get a restarted based bab search to
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> return the optimal answer, but the code then crashes, probably because I
</I>&gt;<i> am
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> not doing things correctly.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> If someone can point me in the right direction, I would be very grateful.
</I>&gt;<i> I sent a
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> message about this about 2 weeks ago to this mailing list, but perhaps I
</I>&gt;<i> did not
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> give the correct information to get any help, so I will try again.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> An outline of what I am doing now:
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> The user defines the problem to be solved in ECLiPSe, and the interface
</I>&gt;<i> maps
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> this to Gecode. At the Gecode level, the problem is represented in
</I>&gt;<i> GecodeSpace,
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> which is derived from Gecode::MinimizeSpace
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Searching can be done with a Gecode search engine, or it can be done at
</I>&gt;<i> the
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> ECLiPSe level (in which case search engines are not used).
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> To do the search with a search engine, I have a GecodeSearch class, which
</I>&gt;<i> has a
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Search::Engine* sengine, which is then dynamically assigned with the
</I>&gt;<i> problem
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> and search engine type when the user specify that a search is to be done
</I>&gt;<i> by
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Gecode with a particular search method (like bab), e.g.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> solver-&gt;vCost = &lt;Cost variable&gt;
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> sengine = Search::bab(solver, option)
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> where solver is a GecodeSpace*, and vCost is the cost variable (for
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> MinimizeSpace).
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> The MPG describes the search engine classes such as BAB, which I don't use
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> directly. I think the reason is that I want to be able to assign different
</I>&gt;<i> types of
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> search engines to sengine, as the search type is only known at run-time,
</I>&gt;<i> and in
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> fact the user can call search as often as they like on the same problem.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> My problem is that I cannot extend this current scheme to work with
</I>&gt;<i> restart-
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> based search. What I tried was to use Search::rbs, which is also of class
</I>&gt;<i> Engine*,
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> and so can be assigned to sengine, but this crashed after returning the
</I>&gt;<i> solution:
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> sengine0 = Search::bab(solver, option);
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> sengine = Search::rbs(solver, metastop, sengine0, metaoption);
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> I needed to use an extra Engine* sengine0, because using the same engine
</I>&gt;<i> in
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> bab and rbs crashed immediately.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> The crash seems to happen when the rbs engine is destroyed, and it looks
</I>&gt;<i> like it
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> is related to using 2 search engines.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Is rbs supposed to be used by the user? I found it by looking for rbs in
</I>&gt;<i> the
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> documentation, but I noticed that although it is listed, it doesn't seem
</I>&gt;<i> to have
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> any description associated with it.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Can I use Engine* in this way if I want to use restart-based search, or do
</I>&gt;<i> I need
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> to use something else (i.e. not a Engine*)?
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Thanks in advance for any help!
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Cheers,
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Kish
