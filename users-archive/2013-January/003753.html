<PRE>Hi,

 

Just two things completely off my head:

-        How does your search control recomputation? Gecode is quite clever,
in particular during BAB.

-        I saw that your variable domains are always from MIN_INT to
MAX_INT. Gecode&#146;s aren&#146;t. This makes quite some difference for Golomb. Check
the MPG case study on Golomb.

 

Best

Christian

Subject: [gecode-users] About the different performance of two &quot;apparently
similar&quot; Gecode models

 

Hi all, 

We are obtaining a different performance in two &#147;apparently similar&#148; Gecode
models, and after performing some test we are blocked in finding out where
this different performance comes from. 

 

CONTEXT:

We are performing a modelling and solving comparison of the Golomb Ruler
problem between Gecode and our Constraint Functional Logic Programming
system TOY(FDg) (which uses Gecode for finite domain constraint solving).
Our hypothesis is that, being Golomb an optimization combinatorial problem,
as soon as it scales, the time spent on search will be almost the 100% of
the total elapsed time (making the inherent surcharge of interfacing
TOY(FDg) to Gecode nearly negligible). 

 

Unfortunately (at least for us J) this does not hold. For example, whereas
for Golomb-11 the Gocode model spends 28sec, the TOY(FDg) model spends 42sec
(a 50% of time more). This difference directly comes from the time they
spent on the search, which is strange, as both models are using the same
formulation (in the sense of a same number of variables with same domain, a
same set of constraints and a same search strategy). Of course the resulting
Gecode code of our TOY(FDg) interfaced model results to be less natural than
the one obtained when modelling directly over Gecode (in the sense of having
to use a single variable vector and devoted predicates for adding each new
variable and constraint arising in the TOY(FDg) goal, as some of its
drawbacks). 

 

To find out the reason of such this difference we have performed some tests,
which I describe to you (all the files I talk about are attached to this
email). We are using Gecode 3.7.3 with Visual Studio 2008.

 

TEST 1.

The test uses:

-      golomb_5_gist_natural.cpp (model using Gecode directly).

-      golomb_5_gist_natural.res (log of the results from running the
model). 

-      golomb_5_gist_natural.pdf (gist tree obtained by running the model). 

 

-      golomb_5_gist_interfaced.cpp (simulation of the resulting Gecode
model obtained from TOY(FDg)).

-      golomb_5_gist_interfaced.res (log of the results from running the
model).

-      golomb_5_gist_interfaced.pdf (gist tree obtained by running the
model). 

 

Both models solve Golomb-5, which contain: 

-      Variables: m[0,m0,m1,m2,m3]; d[d0,d1,d2,d3,d4,d5,d6,d7,d8,d9]. 

-      Constraints: m[i] &lt; m[i+1]; d represents the pairwise differences m;
all_different(d); d[0] &lt; d[last]. 

-      Search: Label m in textual order, minimizing m[last]

 

Conclusions: 

1.	The pdf files show that the Gist tree of the Gecode and TOY(FDg)
models are exactly the same. 
2.	The res files show that the propagation is the same in almost of
nodes, but not in the node remarked in grey in the pdf files. For this node
Gecode makes m = {0, 1, 6, 8, 10} and d = {1, 6, 8, 10, [5..6], [6..7], 9,
2, 4, 3} (lines 73-76 of golomb_5_gist_natural.res), but TOY(FDg) makes
varsSearch = {1, 6, 7, 10, 1, 6, 7, 10, 5, 6, 9, 2, 4, 3} (lines 60-62 of
golomb_5_gist_interfaced.res). As it is seen in the gist trees, both systems
fail in this node, but TOY(FDg) has to do more work to discover it). 

 

TEST 2.

The test uses:

-      golomb_5_bab_natural.cpp (model using Gecode directly).

-      golomb_5_bab_natural.res (log of the results from running the model).


 

-      golomb_5_bab_interfaced.cpp (simulation of the resulting Gecode model
obtained from TOY(FDg)).

-      golomb_5_bab_interfaced.res (log of the results from running the
model).

 

Both models use a search engine (for obtaining statistics of the search) and
the user-defined constraint &#147;checkwhenpruned&#148;, which prints in the log each
modification in the domain of the variables. With that we can control how
the domains of the variables evolve during the search. 

 

Conclusions: 

1.	The res files show that both models explore 19 nodes, with 8 fails.
However, whereas the number of propagators in Gecode is 542, for TOY(FDg) is
544 (possibly the two extra propagators of node remarked in grey in the pdf
files). 
2.	The res files show that there also two more kind of differences in
the propagation of Gecode and TOY(FDg). Lets focus in the lines 66-83 of
golomb_5_bab_natural.res and the lines 71-89 of golomb_5_bab_interfaced.res.
They represent the propagation performed in the node remarked in yellow in
the pdf files (initial state m = {0, 1, [3..11], [6..13], [10..15]} and d =
{1, [3..11], [6..13], [10..15], [2..10], [5..12], [9..14], [2..10], [3..12],
[2..9]} &#224; final state m = {0, 1, 3, [7..11], [11..15]} and d = {1, 3,
[7..11], [11..15], 2, [6..10], [10..14], [4..8], [8..12], [4..8]}, thus
affecting to all the variables): 

2.1.  The order in which the variables see their domain pruned in different
in Gecode and TOY(FDg), which could come from a different order in which the
constraints are being propagated. 

2.2.  The number of prunnings is different. For example, in Gecode there are
18 variable notifications, but in TOY(FDg) there are 19 (the pruning d[5] =
[6..12] appears in TOY(FDg) but not in Gecode. As it is seen in the gist
trees, both systems success in propagation of this node, but TOY(FDg) has to
do more work to discover it).

 

TEST 3.

The test uses:

-      golomb_11_bab_natural.cpp (model using Gecode directly).

-      golomb_11_bab_natural.res (log of the results from running the
model). 

 

-      golomb_11_bab_interfaced.cpp (simulation of the resulting Gecode
model obtained from TOY(FDg)).

-      golomb_11_bab_interfaced.res (log of the results from running the
model).

 

Both models use the computer clock to measure the elapsed time in running
the problem.

 

Conclusions: 

1.	Again, both models explore the same search tree (2968201 nodes and
1484086 fails). But, again, the number of propagators is different
(320150379 for Gecode and 295041321 for TOY(FDg)). Interestingly, for
Golomb-11 is Gecode the one that has (much) more propagators. For Golomb-5
it was TOY(FDg) the one that had (just) two more propagators). 
2.	Regarding the elapsed time for the search, Gecode (28sec) clearly
outperforms TOY(FDg) (42sec). 

 

WE NEED HELP:

1.	Do you think that the big performance difference of Test3 is because
of the reasons we have found in Test1 and Test2 (where TOY(FDg) always has
to work more than Gecode for obtaining the same propagation results)? 
2.	If you think this is not the case, do you have any insight of where
does the performance difference come from? 

 

Thank you very much in advance for spend your time reading this (so long)
email and helping us. 

 

Best regards, 

Nacho Casti&#241;eiras
