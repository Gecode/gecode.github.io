<PRE>Hi Dirk,

if you still have access to the propagators you could check if the accumulated failure count has increased, you will have to know what it was before you started propagation off course. For the propagators you wrote yourself you could (un)register them to your space as (being done) propagating and then you at least know if that one created the failure directly. As you already indicated it will only tell you who was the lucky propagator to conclude failure,

Subject: 	[gecode-users] Getting ID of actor failing a space

Hi folks!

First let me introduce myself to the list: 
I am a software developer for scheduling and planning systems working for a 
small company in germany. As i love gecode i put it into the heart of the 
scheduling system i am currently working on. From the use of gecode the 
following question came up to me:

When using gecode in practice with large models (many many constraints) it is 
sometimes hard to find out why a space is failed. This comes esp. true when 
you implement new propagators or branchers and when you debug them (they dont 
fail the space but because of a bug in the newly added propagator another 
constraint failes...)

I often wished a functionality that lets me tag all actors (propagators, 
branchers) with an ID while posting them and when a space is failed i could 
simply by retrieving that ID (of last executed actor) get some idea which 
constraint failed the space.

Is there some functionality or is there even a better way to do this?

Many thanks in advance!

Dirk
