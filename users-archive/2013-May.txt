Subject: [gecode-users] Display the values of a set of variable without
	duplicates
Message-ID: <518F8AC6.5000208@gmail.com>

Hello,

According to the variables defined in our model (x,y,z,k), I obtained 
the following solutions :

1,1,2,3
1,1,5,6
1,1,7,9
1.1,8,8

I am interested to the values of the two variable x and y, so I want to 
avoid the enumeration of the three last solution in order to display 
just the first solution. After the enumeration of the first solution, I 
think that it is necessary to do a backtrack to the the variable x.

How can I do this?


Thanks.

Hi,

One way to do it is as follows:
 - You create a space s that only has a brancher for x and y
 - You create a search engine e1 for s and find a solution, say s1
 - You post a brancher in s1 for z and k.
 - You create a search engine e2 for s and find just a single solution!
 - You can then also get more solutions from e1 and repeat the previous two
steps.

That should do the trick

Best
Christian

Subject: [gecode-users] Linker errors when compiling Gecode with GCC on
	Windows
Message-ID: <CAHwYJRK3vGoXfDmp9yWCbcE6Tt-imLaMnBPjkkGnNkFy6p=aZQ@mail.gmail.com>

Hi all,

I'm trying to compile some Gecode code with GCC on Windows. I am getting
the following linking errors:

ccUI4ffQ.o:NoOverlap.cpp:(.text$_ZN6Gecode9ExceptionD2Ev[__ZN6Gecode9ExceptionD2Ev]+0xe):
undefined reference to `_imp___ZTVN6Gecode9ExceptionE'
ccUI4ffQ.o:NoOverlap.cpp:(.text$_ZN6Gecode15MemoryExhaustedC1Ev[__ZN6Gecode15MemoryExhaustedC1Ev]+0x1e):
undefined reference to  `_imp___ZN6Gecode9ExceptionC2EPKcS2_'
c:/test/mingw64-4.8/bin/../lib/gcc/i686-w64-mingw32/4.8.0/../../../../i686-w64-mingw32/bin/ld.exe:
C:\Users\Mana\AppData\Local\Temp\ccUI4ffQ.o: bad reloc address 0x1e in
section
`.text$_ZN6Gecode15MemoryExhaustedC1Ev[__ZN6Gecode15MemoryExhaustedC1Ev]'
collect2.exe: error: ld returned 1 exit status

I compiled Gecode myself on Windows using mingw. These errors occur no
matter what libraries I try to link. Always the same error.
For example, I've tried the following command line:

cls && g++ -isystem"C:\Program Files\Gecode\include"
-L"D:\Dropbox\Stuff\Projects\gecode-4.0.0\build" -Wall -std=c++11
NoOverlap.cpp SquarePacking.cpp -lgecodedriver -lgecodeflatzinc
-lgecodefloat -lgecodegist -lgecodeint -lgecodekernel -lgecodeminimodel
-lgecodesearch -lgecodeset -lgecodesupport

But it still gives the same error.
Any ideas?

Hi,

please try linking in the order explained in Sect. 2.3.3 in MPG.  If that doesn't solve the problem, try the --disable-gcc-visibility configure option (although I'm not sure if that works with mingw).  It's possible that the visibility attributes don't work with the current configuration for mingw (we don't test mingw at all).

Cheers,
Guido

As I said, mingw is not officially supported, and I can't test it here.  There were some messages on the mailing list a while ago about how to compile using mingw, and it involved changing quite a few things.

The only thing you could try is to change all the GECODE_VTABLE_EXPORT to GECODE_{KERNEL,SUPPORT,INT,...}_EXPORT in the exception.hpp files (depending on which module they're in), perhaps that does the trick.

Cheers,
Guido

I use clang on Mac OS and Gecode compiles without problems there.  No idea about clang on Windows.

Hi,
the new Lightweight Dynamic Symmetry Breaking could be used also for the graph coloring
example, since the color values are symmetric, right?

Something like (referring to gecode/example/graph-color.cpp)

    Symmetries syms;
    syms << ValueSymmetry(IntArgs::create(g.n_v,0));
    [?]
    branch(*this, v, INT_VAR_SIZE_MIN(), INT_VAL_MIN(), syms);

If the answer is "no", forget about the remaining of this email  :-)



If the answer is "yes", then there is something wrong when using symmetry breaking together
with an activity based branching as:

	branch(*this, v, INT_VAR_ACTIVITY_SIZE_MAX(opt.decay()), INT_VAL_MIN(), sums);

Since the example gives "seg fault". I have tried all the variable selection strategies,
but only those based on the "activity" have this issue.

You can find attached a modified graph-color.cpp example that exposes the problem
(with an additional option for the activity-based branching):

./examples/graph-color -branching sizeact

Thanks in advance,
cheers,
Stefano

Hi Stefano,

 

Yes, that should be symmetric. The bug was a missing initialization and is now fixed in the trunk.

 

I also attached a patch

 

Thanks a lot!

Oh, btw: if you want me to add your modification of the example to Gecode, I?ll do that, provided you:

-        Add yourself as contributing author.

-     Make it controllable from the commandline whether to use LDSB or not.

Message-ID: <51940CE1.4030004@st-andrews.ac.uk>

Hi,

I get a segfault with the attached file, through mzn-gecode (with 
minizinc 1.6 and gecode 4.0.0 compiled from source, on Ubuntu 13.04 64-bit)

I see you have fixed a segfault for Stefano Gualandi, perhaps this file 
will also work now?

Don't worry if this is not an easy fix. The problem is not that 
important, and organizing CP takes higher priority!

Peter

Thanks, that was a simple bug in the FlatZinc parser, I just fixed it in the svn.

Thanks a lot Guido,

I think maybe Gecode needs to output floats rather than ints, Minizinc 
seems to be complaining when parsing solution from Gecode. See output 
below.

Subject: [gecode-users] Some error - I just cannot find it (Windows)
Message-ID: <CAHwYJR+xPewDsiUeKL+3-Wg_N7dKH=BmFX+1Fk6Aqa5zvNFOAw@mail.gmail.com>

Hi all,

In my project that I'm working on, I seem to get strange errors, but I
cannot seem to be able to figure out why, so I figured perhaps you might
give some insight into the problem.
I'm attaching a simplified version (but not a minimal example) of the code
to where I have tracked down the problem. I don't want to force you to sift
through tons of code. I included the most relevant parts only. I can
provide the full source (it isn't that big) upon request, though. That is
fine.

My best guess is that there is some memory corruption - some memory getting
freed and is then overwritten somewhere. But it might be something else
entirely - like I said, I'm not sure because my results are conflicting.
I have the tracked the problem down to being the m_rectangle variable. The
culprit seems to be the line

r1 = std::move(m_rectangles.v().back());

If I remove it, all works fine. I have tried using both a Gecode space
allocator and the normal standard allocator - both produce the same thing.
Because it's memory corruption or something, the bug appears differently
depending on how the code is run - never in a single place (unless run
under the same parameters).

Am I doing this right? Am I missing something? I just can't see what. I
have been trying to wrap my head around this for a long time now, but I
can't seem to find anything.
I hate to ask you to go through a lot of code, but I'm stuck here, so I'd
appreciate a little insight -- any insight.

I just hope the mailing list accepts attachments. I would hate to have to
provide source inline.

Hi Peter,

 

Vincent Barichard did it for us and we just helped him merge. 

 

I am quite happy because it shows that Gecode and its documentation is
accessible enough that our users can pull something like this off.

 

Christian

Thanks a lot Guido, that works fine now. 

I'm impressed that you took the plunge and implemented floating point
propagators.

Message-ID: <000d01ce57bb$115977e0$340c67a0$@itwm.fraunhofer.de>

I am a beginner with gecode and have a problem to formulate a constraint.
I was looking through all channel constraints, however they do not seem to
fit my needs, or I am unable to formulate my needs in the language of the
channel constraints.

I have the following variables
*an IntVar c with a finite set of values {A_1,...,A_n} 
*an IntVarArray p

I have the following fixed parameters
For each value A_t I have a finite set of fixed indexed values I_t (e.g, an
std::set<int>)
A constant B

Now I want to formulate the following constraints
for(t = 1...n){
	c=A_t  ==> for all I in I_t: p[i]=B
}


I thought to create an IntVarArgs of the subset of p with the indices I_t
However, than I have tor formulated for an IntVarArgs q_t:
for(t = 1...n){
	c=A_t  ==> For all elements q_t[i]=B
}

However, I do not find the right expressions to formulate this in gecode...

Oh, I see. That means that there is most likely a bug (could also be ok) in
your own propagator.

Normally, a propagator must be monotonic: it never propagates more when it
is run on bigger variables domains. Or with other words: the smaller the
domains the more it propagates.

Some propagation algorithms do not follow this which might lead to
indeterminstic behavior as you observed. Check 22.9 in MPG.

But most likely it is a bug in your propagator.

Or do you use parallel search with several threads? This can also lead to
non-deterministic behavior.

Cheers
Christian

1. My propagator is very simple : It waits until all v and I are
assigned. Then, it computes a cost function (to optimize) depending from
these variables.


//-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
PropCost RChoquetPropagator::cost(const Space&, const ModEventDelta&) const
{
	return PropCost::binary(PropCost::HI);
}

//-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
ExecStatus RChoquetPropagator::propagate(Space& home, const ModEventDelta&)
{
	if((!v.assigned())||(!I.assigned()))
		return (ES_NOFIX);
	double Res(Compute(*this)); // Make some computation
	if(Res<-1.0||Res>1.0)
		throw std::range_error("Cost function must be in [-1,1]");
	if(Cost.eq(home,Res)==Float::ME_FLOAT_FAILED)
		return ES_FAILED;
	return home.ES_SUBSUMED(*this);
}

2. I don't have program any parallel searches.

I will check 22.9 in MPG (for the moment, I relaunch the program several
times rather than calling a function multiple times in the same program
run).

Subject: [gecode-users] Problem to formulate a constraint
In-Reply-To: <009b01ce57cd$0fda9ae0$2f8fd0a0$@se>
Message-ID: <561ac4bfca00003ba3d496c7e88a5908@egw.itwm.fraunhofer.de>

Hi!

Thank you for your answer. As I stated, I am a beginner to gecode and constraint programming at all. I did not 
try reification, but by this keyword I managed to solve the problem.



However, I still think, that I am formulating my constraint in a bad way. I managed to reduce my 
(sub)problem to the following:

I have an one-dimensional array
#############

Furthermore, I have patterns such as
Pattern 1 = aa#a
Pattern 2 = b#b#b
where the hash means an empty field. 

I want to place these patterns on the array, i.e. possible placements are 
Placement 1: aa#a###b#b#b#
Placement 2: aabab#b######

No I want to store the position (i.e. the column) of each pattern in an IntVarArray c, i.e. in Placement 1 it 
is c=(0; 7) in Placement 2 it is c=(0; 2). However I do not know, how to formulate the non-overlapping.


I have three possible Ideas:
1. For each pattern I have an BoolVarArray to indicate if the pattern is placed there
For Placement 1 I have two arrays (for pattern 1 = 1101000000000) and (for Pattern 2 = 0000000101010)
Then I have constraints
c_a=j <==> x_{j+0} = x_{j+1} = x_{j+3} = 1
c_b=j <==> y_{j+0} = y_{j+2} = y_{j+4} = 1


2. I have one IntVarArray that stores the pattern placed at this field.
For Placement 1 this is 1101000202020
Then I have constraints
c_a=j <==> x_{j+0} = x_{j+1} = x_{j+3} = 1
c_b=j <==> x_{j+0} = x_{j+2} = x_{j+4} = 2


3. I assign different numbers to each point of the the pattern, I.e. pattern 1 = 12#3 and Pattern 2=4#5#6
For Placement 1 this is 1203000405060
Then I have constraints
c_a=j <==> x_{j+0} = 1 
c_a=j <==> x_{j+1} = 2 
c_a=j <==> x_{j+3} = 3
c_b=j <==> x_{j+0} = 4 
c_b=j <==> x_{j+2} = 5 
c_b=j <==> x_{j+4} = 6

However I am somehow lost, how to formulate such constraints efficiently. 
Although this seems a little bit similar to the Pentomino example, with my current gecode-skills I am not 
able to transfer the Ideas.

Best Regards,
Uwe

Hi!

Sorry for spamming the mailing list...
At the moment I am focussing on the 3rd ide of modelling.
Then I have to formulate constraints as

c=j <==> x_{j+u} = v

By substituting i=j-u I get

c=i+u <==> x_i = v

Which looks pretty much like the channel constraint, except that on the right side there is x_i = v instead of x_i = 1.
Do I need additional (temporary) boolean variables to get rid of this?

Best Regards,
Uwe Nowak

That's because those include paths only take affect IF you compile from
within the IDE. If you compile from the command prompt, then you have to
add those include paths to the command line arguments to the compiler
manually.
Any reason why you simply don't build from the IDE itself?

To be more specific , i searsh in the internet for a solution and i find
this tutoril about how to compile carre-magique.cpp with gecode , it sais
that you have to use the commande prompt to compile , that's why i start
with it

But something strang happined , i did compil this exemple with VS commande
prompt just one time, and i built a .exe   but after that when i try
send-more-money , it doesn't work, i dont know whay?????

please forgive my english , i'm note native in it :/

Thanks for any help

Go to project settings, linker, advanced. Make sure "Entry Point" is blank.
If there is any value in there, remove it.
Generally, when building a gecode project, make sure to create a new
project, add the include path under project settings -> vc++ directories.
Add one for the library too (ie lib files). You can make sure this is the
default for all projects by editing global vc++ paths. I'm not going to
mention that here, though.
That's it. Now compile using build -> build solution.

Please read MPG again. You do not tell us whether you installed the x86 or
x64 variant. If it is x86, then the path you give is definitely wrong!

To be more specific , i searsh in the internet for a solution and i find
this tutoril about how to compile carre-magique.cpp with gecode , it sais
that you have to use the commande prompt to compile , that's why i start
with it 

 

But something strang happined , i did compil this exemple with VS commande
prompt just one time, and i built a .exe   but after that when i try
send-more-money , it doesn't work, i dont know whay?????

 

please forgive my english , i'm note native in it :/

 

Thanks for any help

Select Build -> Build Solution in the IDE.

Keep users at gecode.org as CC when replying to make sure the email gets
forwarded to the mailing list, too. You should use reply to all when
responding to a message.

Could you help me pleaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaase , thanks

That's because those include paths only take affect IF you compile from
within the IDE. If you compile from the command prompt, then you have to add
those include paths to the command line arguments to the compiler manually.
Any reason why you simply don't build from the IDE itself?

I use the visual studio command prompt to compile, and i add C:\program

Subject: [gecode-users] Surgery scheduling problem
Message-ID: <CACpA1fTiOfHK3VNLat=qPEjJU=Z4LrvrJ8oSBniseFSxhdy=Cg@mail.gmail.com>

Dear members of the GECODE mailing list,

I am trying to model a surgery scheduling problem as a constraint
programming model. The problem consists in scheduling a set of surgeries to
operating rooms across a one week planning horizon. My testing instance
contains 316 surgeries to be scheduled into 10 timeblocks (OR/shift) of 3
operating rooms. Each surgery has a determined surgeon and estimated
duration. In some days of the week the 3 ORs are working in parallel and we
have to schedule the surgeons among them. The goal is to maximize the
number of surgeries scheduled.

I have tried to model the problem using the binpacking constraint, however
it is different from a binpacking problem as the number of bins is fixed
and I have to select a subset of items, it is more like a knapsack problem,
more specifically a multiple knapsack problem. Does anyone know if I can
use the binpacking constraint limiting the number of bins and not packing
some items?

I have also tried to model the problem using the cumulatives constraint,
however I have multiple resources of two types, more specificaly 3 ORs and
10 surgeons. I was trying to use cumulatives to deal with the multiple ORs
using limit 1, but I am not sure if I can use cumulatives at the same time
to schedule the surgeons, also limited to one.

The problems is like a multiple knapsack problem with parallel resources.
Could you point me to the more efficient way to model this problem?

I have modeled the problem in a naive way, but it is not efficient, so I
would like to use different constraints to improve performance.

Best regards,

Fabr?cio Sperandio

I use windows 7 x86 , and i did what you have told me to do step by step it
worked and it tels me Build succeeded
But when i try to compile with the VS commande prompt the some error comes
again.
this is what i did exactly:

1- after i build it successufly, i opned the Commande prompt and i set :
cd C:\Users\abdelhalim\Documents\Visual Studio 2010\Projects\Carre\Carre (
there where my class .vcxproj is )
2- i set this commande line : cl /DNDEBUG /EHsc /MD /Ox /wd4355 -I"%C:\program
files\Gecode%\include" -c -FoCarre.obj -TpCarre.cpp

here i had this error : fatal error c1083: impossible d'ouvrir le fichier
include : 'gecode/int.hh' : no such file or directory

i really don't know where is the problem and how to fixe it ?? Is the path
that i give is wrong???

Please could anyone help me

Thankx verry much for your help

As said, the Gecode directory is most likely wrong: check the value.

hi 

 

I use windows 7 x86 , and i did what you have told me to do step by step it
worked and it tels me Build succeeded

But when i try to compile with the VS commande prompt the some error comes
again.

this is what i did exactly:

 

1- after i build it successufly, i opned the Commande prompt and i set : cd
C:\Users\abdelhalim\Documents\Visual Studio 2010\Projects\Carre\Carre (
there where my class .vcxproj is )

2- i set this commande line : cl /DNDEBUG /EHsc /MD /Ox /wd4355
-I"%C:\program files\Gecode%\include" -c -FoCarre.obj -TpCarre.cpp

 

here i had this error : fatal error c1083: impossible d'ouvrir le fichier
include : 'gecode/int.hh' : no such file or directory

 

i really don't know where is the problem and how to fixe it ?? Is the path
that i give is wrong???

 

Please could anyone help me 

 

Thankx verry much for your help

Please read MPG again. You do not tell us whether you installed the x86 or
x64 variant. If it is x86, then the path you give is definitely wrong!

Select Build -> Build Solution in the IDE.

Keep users at gecode.org as CC when replying to make sure the email gets
forwarded to the mailing list, too. You should use reply to all when
responding to a message.

That's because those include paths only take affect IF you compile from
within the IDE. If you compile from the command prompt, then you have to add
those include paths to the command line arguments to the compiler manually.
Any reason why you simply don't build from the IDE itself?

Why are you switching back to the command prompt again? You are only making
things harder than they should be.

Subject: [gecode-users] Surgery scheduling problem

Hi,

this is more of a modelling question than about Gecode, but here are some ideas.  I'd try to model the ORs as a cumulative resource of capacity 3, and then add fixed dummy tasks during the time slots where not all of them are available.  The surgeries could either become optional tasks, or you let the schedule overflow the time horizon and regard everything after the one week mark as not scheduled.  To schedule the surgeons, you'd probably need to resort to reified constraints (mapping time slots to surgeons) and then constraining the surgeons in one time slot to be all different.

But given the size of the problem, I'm not sure the model is the issue here, perhaps it's more important to find a good branching heuristic.

Cheers,
Guido

My testing instance contains 316 surgeries to be scheduled into 10 timeblocks (OR/shift) of 3 operating rooms. Each surgery has a determined surgeon and estimated duration. In some days of the week the 3 ORs are working in parallel and we have to schedule the surgeons among them. The goal is to maximize the number of surgeries scheduled.

Hi,

yes, you should channel your c_a and c_b arrays to BoolVars, then you can simply post the constraints directly using the minimodel abstractions:

BoolVarArgs b_a(...);
channel(home, b_a, c_a);
BoolVarArgs b_b(...);
channel(home, b_b, c_b);

for (int j=0; j<n; j++) {
  rel(home, b_a[j] == (x[j+0] == 1));
  rel(home, b_a[j] == (x[j+1] == 2)); 
  ...
}

Cheers,
Guido

The propagator looks ok (waiting for all variables to be assigned is definitely monotonic). I think I'd add some debugging output to your propagate function, printing the v and l arrays and the resulting Cost whenever it is computed successfully.  Perhaps that at least gives you an idea if the integer variables are already different or if it's the floating point computation.

Cheers,
Guido

Yes, that was also my suspicion: maybe it is a rounding issue.

The propagator looks ok (waiting for all variables to be assigned is
definitely monotonic). I think I'd add some debugging output to your
propagate function, printing the v and l arrays and the resulting Cost
whenever it is computed successfully.  Perhaps that at least gives you an
idea if the integer variables are already different or if it's the floating
point computation.

 

Cheers,

Guido

2. I don't have program any parallel searches.

I will check 22.9 in MPG (for the moment, I relaunch the program several
times rather than calling a function multiple times in the same program
run).

Oh, I see. That means that there is most likely a bug (could also be ok) in
your own propagator.

Normally, a propagator must be monotonic: it never propagates more when it
is run on bigger variables domains. Or with other words: the smaller the
domains the more it propagates.

Some propagation algorithms do not follow this which might lead to
indeterminstic behavior as you observed. Check 22.9 in MPG.

But most likely it is a bug in your propagator.

Or do you use parallel search with several threads? This can also lead to
non-deterministic behavior.

Hi,
I have a strange problem : I have a function that runs a Gecode

other



ones.



I have make some runs with valgrind, but I see nothing. Has anyone an

Hi,

your sample code does not compile, are you sure it's self contained?  E.g. XGecodeVector2 initialises m_valid which is not defined (and there seem to be other problems).

Hi,

No, it's not entirely self contained. It was just a dumbed down cut and
paste in order to see if anyone could find some quick glaring errors.
Anyway, here is a minimal example that produced the bug - the crash, at
least as far as I could conveniently reduce it to.
To reproduce the crash: run Gist to find all solutions (press "A"). Then
double-click twice on the solution node (the yellow node).
The program will crash.

I tried it on Mac OS and it works, no crash.  Perhaps it's a problem in the compiler's support for C++11, it's all still quite experimental it seems. Did you compile Gecode with exactly the same flags and compiler as the example?

I used the recommended flags as mentioned in the MPG from the IDE, which
basically mounts down to the default.
I wish I had another compiler on windows to test it with, though, but so
far, no luck with that.

Subject: [gecode-users] setup times in unary resource
Message-ID: <CAP7RSvtrXyZsyLo9-vxpivnH1cAr7dMGJiiup4JJECCtHB-EYA@mail.gmail.com>

Dear all -

I am new to Gecode but not to CP, and I am exploring its capabilities for a
possible use in a project.

Is there a way to express setup / transition times in the unary constraint?

Thanks
Alessandro

Subject: [gecode-users] Display the values of a set of variable without
	duplicates
Message-ID: <51A8587E.7030903@gmail.com>

Hello,

I already asked for the following problem:

According to the variables defined in our model (x,y,z,k), I obtained the following solutions :
  1,1,2,3
  1,1,5,6
  1,1,7,9
  1.1,8,8
I am interested to the values of the two variable x and y, so I want to avoid the enumeration
of the three last solution in order to display just the first solution.

I got the following response:

One way to do it is as follows:
  - You create a space s that only has a brancher for x and y
  - You create a search engine e1 for s and find a solution, say s1
  - You post a brancher in s1 for z and k.
  - You create a search engine e2 for s and find just a single solution!
  - You can then also get more solutions from e1 and repeat the previous two
steps.

Thank you for the solution, it works very well, but I have an other problem
which is the enumeration order of the variables x, y, z and k. I must begin
the branching from the variables  z and k, then x, y (In this way, Gecode
enumerates quickly the solutions but for the first order "x,y,z,k", it takes
about 30 minutes to enumerate the first solution).
Is there an other solution?

Thank you.

Hi Alessandro,

 

No, there is no direct support for this right now in Gecode, please consult
Section 4.4.18 in Modeling and Programming with Gecode.

Hi,

I am not sure whether I understand your question correctly. But you can
exchange the order of the search engine (that is, in my previous reply swap
e1 and e2).

After several tests, it seems in fact that it is a rounding issue :
several combinations of the parameters give an identical result if
printed. I will check further if there is no bug in my code, but it
seems that is not a Gecode problem.
Thanks.
