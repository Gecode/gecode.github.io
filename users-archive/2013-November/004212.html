<PRE>Hi,

 

Gecode does not work with cygwin (this has been discussed several times alread on this mailing list). As explained in MPG you have to install Microsoft Visual Studio, try the current free version Visual Studio Express 2013 and then install Gecode with the matching msi. Luckily, the current Visual Studio version supports both x64 (64 bit) as well as x86 (32 bit), so you can actually choose which variant of Gecode you want to use with Visual Studio.

 

Cheers

Christian

Subject: [gecode-users] Installation on Windows w/ or wo/ Cygwin

 

Hello all,

    I have just started to use Gecode as part of a university course on CSP.

   First, congrats for the tool and the amazing work you do in supporting it.

    

    I am trying to install the tool on a Windows 8 system and some doubts have arised during the process as well as some issues related to Cygwin. I have made some effort on reading the documentation (Chapter 2 mainly of MGP) and reviewed some previous questions on this list.

 

    Going to the point:

 

    1) On a Windows installation, using the .msi packages. Is it required to do something else? I understand not but want to be sure. I don&#8217;t want to start working and then finding that the installation was not properly completed. 

        I have missed a Test.exe that validates that the installation is OK as it exists for Linux although I also understand that if nothing needs to be done after msi install, then the test would be very simple (if any needed).

        Does this means that I can use Gecode on a 100% Windows environment (no cygwin at all)? Section 2.3.1 indicates in other direction and combines VSstudio with Cygwin. Is that required or just an option? I understand I have all the .h* and libs in the installation folder.

        The documentation(section 2.6.1) refers to pre-compiled binaries... are those the .msi or do you refer to the .tar.gz?

 

    2) On a Windows installation using cygwin, that I have also attempted. I have been able to make the install using CC=&#8221;gcc&#8221; CXX=&#8221;g++&#8221;.

         Everything gets installed, even to the /usr/local folders and the Test.exe shows everything is working.

        I need this to work since the teacher uses a Linux machine for the lab classes. In addition some scripts are distributed to compile some examples that I would need to modify during the class.

         I cab compile but I have not been able to link.

         Here is where I have my doubts. I have read in some old questions to the list, that you were considering not supporting cygwin with g++/gcc due to the problems with dynamic linking. The discussions date back to 2008 and 2010. 

         Is it a supported configuration? 

         Which additional settings should I add to my linking command?

 

   g++ -o basic -L/usr/local/lib basic.o -lgecodedriver -lgecodesearch -lgecodeminimodel -lgecodeint -lgecodekernel &#8211;lgecodesupport      

 

         Thanks in advance for your support.

 

            Jose A. Maga&#241;a
