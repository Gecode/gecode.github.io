Subject: [gecode-users] unassign variables
Message-ID: <CAL1Z-6zK45_0JvhHkbTq3U5ikuZMKkGuc3ykq9UpzwvH04CN4g@mail.gmail.com>

Hi Everyone,

Is there any way to unassign a variable?
In my application i'm building a model: creating variables and constraints
from them, thees constraints actually BoolExpr objects created using the
minimodel module.
At a point I'd like to solve the  actual constraint (a BoolExpr), I solve
it, concrete values assigned to the variables that I created earlier, and
that the constraint created from. But later, I build other constraints from
these variables, and when I try to solve them, the variables are assigned
yet, but they should not be for me.

I tried to make copy of the vars, but if I use the copy constructor it
actually does not make a "hard copy". I also tried make hard copies like
this:

IntVar var(space, 0, 10);
IntVar hard_copy(space, var.min(), var.max());

but this method creats a totally new variable, which is not part of the
constraint to be solved. :(

Thank you,
Steve

Hi,

 

If you set up your problem (and the variables) correctly as described in
MPG, then it is quite simple:

- create a space s for your problem

- create a clone c of s (by the clone member function): now the variables in
s have been cloned to c.

- solve on s

- later you can use c where the variables are not assigned.

hi all!

i program a model where i have to maximize the profit ( objective

maximize or minimize. i used other solvors and i find functions that do
that by default for exemple the Choco solvor.

When i read the MPG, i found just Support for cost-based optimization so i
tryed to use it to solve my model ( of course i looked at the exemple
SendMostMoney
and i tryed to do the some but here :

  virtual Space* copy(bool share) {
    return new exempleMMKP(share,*this);
  }
i have got an error : object type abstract class "exempleMMKP" unauthorized

So what can i do to slve this problem

thank very much

That is a C++ programming error you did, googling this would have revealed
that: the class is abstract, so you forgot to define one of the virtual
member functions required.

 

Maybe you forgot the cost function itself?

Hi,

I think you need to brush up on your C++, that's the type signature, not the code you should write.  Just check our documentation, you can construct an IntVarArgs from a vector v like this IntVarArgs x(v);

Cheers,
Guido

Hi

Sorry to be so bothring but this instruction that YOU gave me : IntVarArgs
x(v); doesn't work for me!!!!

let me explain: by just writing this instruction in the model it gave me
also an error because none of the declaration that exist in the site of
Gecode does match the argument list????

this is what i wrote : vector<int> W;
for (int i=0;i< 10;i++)
 W.push_back(i);
             IntVarArgs R(W);

i konw there is a mistack here but i don't konw what is it ??? I'm really
 new with Gecode that's why i do so my errors
So sorry to be so bothring

Thank YOU for any help at all

Message-ID: <CA+wh-JvENCuTDyTSANWAuF7Oa1dCjkROPsPriC9WXd8m5oOmtA@mail.gmail.com>

Hi everyone!

In my model, I have to get the variables of my matrix from a program that
is written in JAVA. Firstable, i get these varibles from another class in
C++ and the model worked, but when i try to send the argument from java get
this error :

Exception: Matrix::Matrix(A, w, h): Sizes of argument arrays mismatch.

but i used the same size of argument !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

this is a part of the code and it works in C++:


MMKP (const Options& opt) :
a(*this,reader2.lire_size_nodes()*reader2.lire_size_testers(), 0,1){

        const int nodes=reader2.lire_size_nodes();
        const int testers= reader2.lire_size_testers();
        Matrix <BoolVarArray> X (a,nodes,testers);////// here when i get
the error


So Do you have any idea about that ?????

Thank YOU

Well,  the argument sizes do not match as the exception tells you: the width
* height of the matrix is different from the size of the underlying array.

 

Please check that

How on earth should that work: you use a vector of integers (that is,
vector<int>) to initialize an array of integer VARIABLES that is,
(IntVarArgs).

 

You really need to read MPG more carefully. Maybe you meant IntArgs as an
array of integers?

Subject: [gecode-users] peak memory value
Message-ID: <CADfnOYv2ZfEw1NMnpET5ShV81UzZoKnD_EUgN6bmnvptf4v4og@mail.gmail.com>

Hi All,

I understand the how adaptive recomputation works, but I still have a
question regarding the peak memory usage of adaptive recomputation.

For the Ortho-Latin problem, I ran the script by the following two command
line respectively:

1.   ./ortho-latin  -c-d 8 -a-d 2 -solutions 1

2.  ./ortho-latin  -c-d 10000 -a-d 2 -solutions 1


These two commands explore the exactly same search tree. It is expected
that the first run will place a bit more space copies within the search
tree than the second, and thus have a larger peak memory value. However, I
checked that the peak memory usage of the first command is 1319 K; the peak
memory for the second command is 1511K. How do you think about it? Thanks!


regards,
Lin



For the search tree information of ortho-latin:

peak depth: 46
first solution found at level: 44
first failure happened at level: 22
All failures happened at deeper level than the first failure.

That's just fine, adaptive recomputation might create more copies if failure
occurs. Rather than explaining it, check it out yourself: use Gist and
switch on "Show clones in tree" in the search preferences.

Hi !
Thank YOU for your help , i konw what i did is wrong because there is a
defference between the tow type of varibles, but how can i put my variables
that exist in vector<int> into IntVar Args or any other type of variables
used in linear constraints. It is easy to fillful the IntVarArgs by a
simple declaration like what is described in MPG , but my problem is when i
have another sort of varibles for exemple the keybord or an xml file or
something like that.

i tryed a simple exemple like this :

IntArgs R(n,20,10,15,5,25,30); // that works verry well

but when i have this variables (20,10,15,5,25,30) in a vector , i have to
put theme in a type that can be used in linear constraint right and this is
the problem : how can i put theme in an IntVarArgs for exemple

Sorry to bother you with this stupid things but it really bother me, any
help , tahnk you

PETER

How on earth should that work: you use a vector of integers (that is,
vector<int>) to initialize an array of integer VARIABLES that is,
(IntVarArgs).****

You really need to read MPG more carefully. Maybe you meant IntArgs as an
array of integers?****

Hi,

I think you need to brush up on your C++, that's the type signature, not
the code you should write.  Just check our documentation, you can construct
an IntVarArgs from a vector v like this IntVarArgs x(v);

Cheers,

Hi Christian,

Thanks for your reply. I haven't been able to look again at this issue 
until now, so sorry for the delay...

Am I correct that for the above, x would be the variables that are being 
labelled by the search (i.e. the variables passed to branch()), and y is 
the solution values for these variables (x and y can be swapped, of 
course)? Also, this rel constraint should be posted in master()?

I am not quite sure how to pass y (the solution values) to the master() 
function and space. Can this be done without some low-level programming 
(i.e. inside the search engine)?

If this is not easy to do, then I think an alternative behaviour I can 
implement is to not allow the user to ask for an alternative solution if 
restart is used with DFS. Am I correct in thinking that restart is 
probably not that useful if you want to search for multiple solutions of 
a problem, because the search (unless you use some randomisation, as you 
mentioned) will always drive you close to solutions you already found, 
before exploring other parts of the search space.

Cheers,

Kish

Hi Kish,

Sorry for missing this.

If you want to post the constraint then you would have to store the
y-variables at someplace such that the master() function (you would have to
re-define it) can access y.

The second option is more meaningful: I think restricting restart to a
single solution does not hurt.

Cheers

Thanks for your reply. Am I correct in thinking that the restart search 
facilities do not provide any way of passing extra current information 
from the search back to the master() (for DFS; I guess I can (ab)use the 
constrain() function in my case, as what I want to pass back is a 
constraint, by changing the DFS search to BAB)?

Naively (because I don't know the details of Gecode), it seems to me 
that providing the user with access to the master space during the 
search will allow a simple way of passing information to the master 
space. I can see that being useful if the user want to do things that 
depends on the state of the search when restarting a search/finding a 
new solution.

> The second option is more meaningful: I think restricting restart to a

I am a little reluctant to do this, as this does not fit that well with 
how I intend to provide the functionality in ECLiPSe, as I want to add 
restart and no-goods as extra options to gfd's search routine, i.e. not 
as different search methods.

Cheers,

Kish

Hi Kish,

Well, you get access to the master space: remember the master() function is
called on the _master_ space. That should be sufficient, or?

Message-ID: <CAFWj1gB+fScDook0KcGU3ouWjZa2vUsMkFOwxqs_gAJtnZPaGg@mail.gmail.com>

Dear Sir,

I would like to know how can I use Gecode with extensional between BoolVar
and IntVar

I show you my problem :
I have boolvars :  x1 x2
and intvars x3 x4

I have some valid tuples :
0 1 3 4
0 0 6 6
1 1 7 3

How can I use constraint Gecode::extensional to use BoolVar and IntVar
together ?
This is not the case with Gecode 4.2.0

Maybe do I use a clause constraint to express the constraint extensional
for BooVar and the constraint extensional for IntVar ?

Dear Mohamed,

 

I only have an inefficient solution here: you can introduce IntVars y1 and
y2 and use the channel constraint:

                channel(home, x1, y1); channel(home, x2, y2);

and then you can use y1 and y2 together with x3 and x4 and the extensional
constraint.

 

Best

Christian

How can I use constraint Gecode::extensional to use BoolVar and IntVar
together ?

This is not the case with Gecode 4.2.0

 

Maybe do I use a clause constraint to express the constraint extensional for
BooVar and the constraint extensional for IntVar ?

Just do something like this: assume that you have n Boolean vars stored in
an array x and m integer vars stored in an array y. Then do:

                IntVarArgs xy(n+m);

                for (int i=0; i<n; i++) {

                                BoolVar b(home,0,1); xy[i]=b;

                                channel(home, x[i], xy[i]);

              }

                for (int i=0; i<m; i++) xy[n+i]=y[i]; 

 

That's just C++

Dear Mohamed,

 

I only have an inefficient solution here: you can introduce IntVars y1 and
y2 and use the channel constraint:

                channel(home, x1, y1); channel(home, x2, y2);

and then you can use y1 and y2 together with x3 and x4 and the extensional
constraint.

 

Best

Christian

Dear Sir,

 

I would like to know how can I use Gecode with extensional between BoolVar
and IntVar


 

I show you my problem :

I have boolvars :  x1 x2

and intvars x3 x4

 

I have some valid tuples :

0 1 3 4

0 0 6 6

1 1 7 3

 

How can I use constraint Gecode::extensional to use BoolVar and IntVar
together ?

This is not the case with Gecode 4.2.0

 

Maybe do I use a clause constraint to express the constraint extensional for
BooVar and the constraint extensional for IntVar ?

Hi Gecoder,

I am currently facing the problem of compiling Gecode 4.2 on a very old 
system featuring g++ v4.1.2 only.

What was the reason for the g++ v4.2 dependency and is it possible to 
ignore/disable it? I am "only" needing the following modules

  - minimodel
  - int-vars
  - set-vars
  - search

no QT, Gist, etc. needed..

Thanks for thinking about it.
Martin

Hi Martin,

there were bugs in gcc 4.1 that resulted in incorrect code, especially the set constraints were affected by this.  You can of course simply change the check in configure.ac, but I can't guarantee that the resulting code works.  You could run the tests and see if they fail (I think they just used to go into an infinite loop somewhere for the sets).

I haven't built with gcc 4.1 for a long time so I'm not even sure it compiles any longer.

Alternatively, perhaps you can build a fully statically linked version on a newer system.

Cheers,
Guido

Message-ID: <CAF2wyP3EepwaN08aaYXiO-OuzR632Yd-k9ncDK5xBfGwPAH-JA@mail.gmail.com>

Hello all,

I'd like to know if it is planned to make a version compatible with the
android ndk ?
It seems that the case for the NDK's pthread.h is not implemented and so an
application cannot compile. Unless there is something wrong in my
configuration...

Best regards,

Hi,

we don't have plans to support the Android NDK (we simply don't have the resources right now to adapt and test everything on every possible system).  But of course if you manage to create a patch that would make Gecode work with the NDK, that would be very welcome and we may include it in the main distribution.

Technically I believe the pthread API in Android is a bit limited compared to full posix threads, so I'm not even sure it can be done. Alternatively you could switch off thread support altogether.  Currently configure just checks for the presence of pthread.h, but if you simply remove the call to AC_GECODE_THREADS from configure.ac and run autoconf, configure, make, this might work.  Please let me know, if this solves the problem I'll add a configure switch to disable thread support entirely.

Cheers,
Guido

Hello,

Thank you for your answer.
I decided to switch off thread support as you said.
It compiles if i add #include <cstddef> inside gecode/support/thread.hpp
and if, in the same file,
i replace line 130 :
#ifdef GECODE_THREADS_WINDOWS by #if defined(GECODE_THREADS_WINDOWS) ||
!defined(GECODE_THREADS_PTHREADS)
in order to have FastMutex defined.

Cheers,
Christine

Great, thanks for the patch!  I added it to the svn trunk and also made thread support configurable (with the --disable-thread switch).

Let me also thank for this,
this makes Gecode even more usable as a library in a project where you
do not use the thread support of gecode
(always problems with linking to pthread)

Max

Subject: [gecode-users] Stability of a solution
Message-ID: <loom.20131016T000010-810@post.gmane.org>

Hi all,

I have a constraint satisfaction problem correctly solved by gecode 
using a Branch & ?Bound engine. However, I have a stability issue : 
This problem should be solved frequently with minor changes and I 
get a different solution each time I solve it (I solve it from scratch
 every 3 s and the search is time constrained to 10 ms)

Thus, to have a stable solution, I have to know if the previous solution
 is still valid and I have to compare its cost (relatively the updated problem) 
to the best new solution. Unfortunately, this previous solution is not always
 analyzed (even if this solution is ?probably still relevant) since I am time 
constrained.

Is there an elegant way to check if the previous solution is still valid and to
 compute its cost?

Thanks for tips,
Cheers,
Philippe

Hi Philippe,

I assume from what you write that you the variables of your problem(s) stay the same while the constraints change. Is tthat correct?

Then, what you can do is to take a space for the new problem (with the new constraints) and assign the variables in the new problem to the values of the old problem. If the space fails, the old solution is not any longer valid. The cost can be accessed as always...

Hope that helps
Christian

Hi Christian,
 
Thank you very much for your help.
Even if your solution is the one I had in mind, I'm not sure that we have
the same assumptions :
 
The constraints remains the same (for instance "allocate some task to device",
"A task cannot be allocated more than once",  ...) but the domain of the
variables change (for instance, the priority of a task, the duration of a task)
that's what I call "minor changes of the problem". but I can also have
new tasks, removed tasks. In that case, the changes are not so minor.
 
However, I was thinking about a solution similar to yours :
- find the best task's affectations of the new problem
- Once done, do the same but add the constraint that "the task's affectation
  to optimize must be the same than the one found in the old problem"
- check if the space fails. If not, retrieve the cost.
 
So, here is the pseudo code :
-----------------------------
 
// First, find the new task affectation
 
TaskAff * taskAff = new TaskAff(tasks, priorities, durations);
BAB<TaskAff> search_engine(taskAff, opt);
delete taskAff;
 
while(TaskAff *taskAff = search_engine.next())
                {
                               taskAff->get_solution(affectations);
                               delete taskAff;
                }
 
// second, do the same but with a new constraint "affectations = previous_aff"
//
TaskAff * taskAff = new TaskAff(tasks, priorities, durations, previous_aff);

If (! taskAff->failed())
       {
         taskAff->get_cost();
         delete taskAff;
        }
               
Are we ok ?        

                              
Cheers,
Philippe

Hi,

Not really knowing the details, I think this looks like a feasible plan even
though it all depends on whether the second point in your list is
sufficiently easy to do.

Hi,

I am creating a system to solve resource delivery problems and am having reasonable success but I want to be able to fully constrain whole events, which means I need a way to alternate branching between the start of an event and the associated duration.  At the moment I constrain all the starts and then do the durations but this sometimes causes me to need to backtrack more than I want to and also seems to slow the solver down because there are more unconstrained variables than need be.

At the moment the simplest solution that would be acceptable would be simply to set the duration to its maximum value whenever the associated start time is assigned, but I would like an interleaved branching method eventually.

Any advice on how to proceed would be appreciated.

Regards,

Duane.

Hi All,

I want to use gcode in my c# project base on visual studio.net 2012. could
anyone help me about a clear procedure to do that? i am totally unfamiliar
with C++. also I tried to use the dll files in bin directory of gecode
install directory, but c# didn't accept them as reference. also I tried to
use cmake to build a visual c++ solution but I got errors (maybe something
wrong in cmake or created visual c++ settings).

Thanks.

Erfan

Hi,

You might have to bite the bullet and implement your own brancher. This is
explained in Part B of Modeling & Programming with Gecode.

Hello all,
I would modify the unary constraint in order to allow negative durations
(tend<tstart) when the boolvar m (mandatory) is 0.

Is there an easy way to do this?

Thank you,

Hi,

 

There is a generic trick for situations like this: you introduce new
variables tend', tstart' and tdur' and only enforce that they are equal to
tend, tstart, tdur respectively when the Boolean variable is 1. That means
if the Boolean variable is 0, the new variables can have whatever value.

 

Hope that helps

Christian

Yes, sure it's useful, thank you.
I'm just wondering whether a modification of the unary might be more
efficient or not.
In such a case, I could modify the source files of Gecode, by adding
another (modified) unary constraint, otherwise... should I write an
user-defined propagator?

I've the same doubt regarding the nooverlap, I'd like to achieve a
generalization of it.
In this generalization rectangles of the same "group" can overlap
eachother, but they cannot overlap other rectangles of other groups.
So the new nooverlap will take in input an IntArgs array which contains the
group IDs.

In your guide I read:
"The constraints [nooverlap] are implemented by a naive propagator
(considering pairwise no-
overlap between rectangles including constructive disjunction, see also
GCCAT: diffn),
this will change in the future. "

I could add a condition within the implementation of the nooverlap, that
checks if the two rectangles belong to two different groups. Is it right?

Do you have any suggestion?

Thank you,
Andrea
