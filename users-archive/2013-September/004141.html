<PRE>Hi Kish,

In your idea of doing several searches after each other I assume that you
use the next() function to get a space and then continue search. As the
no-goods are posted in the master space they will be contained in the space
returned by next() as well (unless they already have been found out to be
useless).

As for making sure that the same solution is not found again there is some
support but not really the right one. For integer variable arrays x and y
(also for Boolean arrays) you can post by
	rel(home, x, IRT_NQ, y);
cannot be the same, that is there is at least one i for which x_i is
different from y_i.

For other variable types this does not exist but you can always use
reification like this: assume that x is an array of integer (or set, float,
... ) variables and y is an array of integers (or floats, or sets, or
whatever). Then the following code snippet does  what you want:
	BoolVarArgs b(x.size());
	for (int i=0; i&lt;x.size(); i++)
        b[i] = expr(home, x[i] != y[i]);
      rel(home, BOT_OR, b, 1);

Hope that helps!

Best
Christian

Hi Christian,

Thanks for your reply!

I was thinking about what happens when there is more than one search, i.e.
after  a search -- search1 --  in a space (using a subset of variables of
the space), another search (with a different subset of
variables) -- search2 -- is done on the space. Each of these search will use
their own search engines, and can use different search engines, with
different options.

I understand that the no-goods are posted in the master space, but I assume
the master space in search1 is not the same as search2. My question was if
the no-goods gathered in search1 will be posted in
search2 (assuming both are doing a restart search with no-goods).
As far as I can see, there is no need to post these no-goods from search1,
because a different subset of variables are used in search2, and in addition
I assume the no-goods from search1 will be represented as constraints in the
master space of search2.

&gt;<i> If you do nothing extra (such as randomization or BAB where the 
</I>&gt;<i> constrain() function is called on the master etc) restarting after

</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
I am thinking here of what to do with next() when using a restart DFS search
engine in the context of the ECLiPSe interface.

For Gecode, I can understand that you want to leave any extra thing to be
done to the user.

For the interface, the user is programming in ECLiPSe, and anything extra
must be done by the interface. After obtaining a solution, I want a call to
next() to return a different answer (if this exist), and potentially to be
able to return all the solutions, as in a non-restart DFS. The only way I
can think of doing this is to post the previous solution as a no-good, and
this has to be done regardless of what nogoods_limit is. Is this possible,
and/or is there some other way of ensuring that the previous solution will
not be returned?

Cheers,

Kish
