<PRE>Hi,

One of our ECLiPSe user is trying out his program with our Gecode 
interface (his original is written for ECLiPSe's native ic solver), and 
one of the problem he has run into is that the execution seems to 
consume a lot of memory (&gt; 1.5G), and reducing the cloning apparently 
does not help much.

However, he can only measure the memory consumption indirectly, by 
looking at the memory usage of the process, and so it is difficult to be 
precise.

Is there any existing way of measuring, or at least estimating, the 
amount of memory used by Gecode? In this case, the search is done in 
ECLiPSe, rather than using Gecode's search engines, so the creation of 
clones of the Space are all done from ECLiPSe, so I assume Gecode have 
not got a &quot;global&quot; way of tracking all the cloned Spaces. However, I 
should be able to do this from ECLiPSe, but I need to be able to get the 
memory usage (or estimate) of each Space -- is there any available 
procedure to get this?

Thanks in advance for any information/help!

Kish
