<PRE>Hi,

This is most likely okay and can happen due to recomputation during search:
it might be the case that the variable has already been assigned by
propagation during recomputation before the commit operation is executed.

If you want to test whether this behavior is due to recomputation you can in
fact disable recomputation by passing 1 as a vlue for the commit
recomputation distance (-c-d 1 on the command line).

Cheers
Christian

Subject: [gecode-users] commit on already-assigned variable

Hej!

I'm working on implementing bit-vector variables in gecode, following the
example given in MPG.

A part of this is providing relevant View selection for the brancher. I have
done so with a NONE implementation which also follows the model given in
MPG, which returns parameterized a ViewSelNone:

    return new (home) ViewSelNone&lt;BitView&gt;(home, bvb);

Where BitView is the type of views on the variable implementations
(typedef'd as unsigned int), and bvb is a &quot;BitVarBranch&quot;. So far, so good.

Later, I have defined a ValCommit class, including a commit function:

    ModEvent commit(Space&amp; home, unsigned int a, BitView x, int i, BitType
n);

Since I am branching based on the values of certain bits of the BitView x,
there are only two alternatives (a == 0, a != 0). The parameter n provides a
mask with only a single set bit which determines the bit on which branching
occurs. 

My issues is that the search engine appears to be calling commit() on
already-assigned variables which violates a check I have implemented there
to validate the input as well as violates my expectation of how the engine
should function with a NONE-typed variable/view selection.

Specifically, I have an array of 64 4-bit bitvector variables and at some
point during search, commit() is called on variable 56, which is already
assigned. I have verified in GDB that the variable is, in fact, assigned. I
can see in GDB that this variable is branched on a number of times before
failure. The relevant backtrace when failure occurs:

#0  BV::Bit::ValCommitBitSplit::commit (this=0x9972500, home=..., a=0,
x=..., i=56, n=1) at src/bitvec/branch.cpp:144
#1  0x08068331 in Gecode::ValSelCommit&lt;BV::Bit::ValSelRndBit,
BV::Bit::ValCommitBitSplit&gt;::commit (this=0x99724f8, home=..., a=0,
    x=..., i=56, n=1) at
gecode/gecode/kernel/brancher-val-sel-commit.hpp:175
#2  0x080774b8 in Gecode::ViewValBrancher&lt;BV::Bit::BitView, 1, unsigned int,
2u&gt;::commit (this=0x9972610, home=..., c=..., b=0)
    at gecode/gecode/kernel/brancher-view-val.hpp:286
#3  0x4003911c in Gecode::Space::_commit (this=0x80b13a0, c=..., a=0) at
gecode/kernel/core.cpp:417
#4  0x40046dad in commit (a=&lt;optimized out&gt;, c=..., this=0x80b13a0) at
./gecode/kernel/core.hpp:2786
#5  commit (i=137, s=0x80b13a0, this=0x80cfb88) at
./gecode/search/sequential/path.hh:259
#6  recompute (stat=..., a_d=&lt;optimized out&gt;, d=@0x80cfba8: 3,
this=0x80cfb88) at ./gecode/search/sequential/path.hh:325
#7  next (this=0x80cfb44) at ./gecode/search/sequential/dfs.hh:148
#8  Gecode::Search::WorkerToEngine&lt;Gecode::Search::Sequential::DFS&gt;::next
(this=0x80cfb40) at ./gecode/search/support.hh:84
#9  0x0804dcda in next (this=&lt;optimized out&gt;) at
gecode/gecode/search/dfs.hpp:53
#10 main (argc=4, argv=0xbffff2f4) at src/main.cpp:75

I'm not quite sure how to proceed since the search process is rather
difficult to step through in the debugger and since I'm using the built-in
ViewSelNone.

Any suggestions? I can provide code for any relevant methods, but it's not
clear to me which would be actually useful for you guys to see.

System info:
OS: debian linux, kernel 2.6.32.33-kvm-i386-20111128-dirty, 
    running in a VM (KVM or UML, I'm not quite sure) Gecode version: 4.2.1,
built from source
g++ (Debian 4.7.2-5) 4.7.2

Cheers,
Kellen
