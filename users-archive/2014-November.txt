Dear all,

I am implementing the "employee scheduling program" from book "Hybrid
Optimization" by Michela Milano 2011.

I am unable to find how can i implement the stretch-cycle constraint in
Gecode. I have checked the manual and the mailing list archives. The
sequence constraint is not sufficient in my case.

Please guide me!

Thanks

Hi,

if a constraint is not available natively in Gecode you have two options: decompose it into simpler constraints, or implement a propagator for it (see MPG).

Cheers,
Guido

Message-ID: <CAFcfiNX_JXs3ot0Gg1fBi+sh82knEp8E6TfRNVyJ9eWZ4TC4TQ@mail.gmail.com>

Dear Gecode users,

This is probably a naive question and very related to C++. However, it is
quite related to gecode as well. In my use case I have a shared pointer to
an object that contains all the information of a problem instance. As
usual, the constructor is where the CSP is defined and that object is
passed as an argument to it.

In addition, I implemented a brancher that also require some of the
information pointed by the shared pointer.  Note that this infromation is
not actually needed to construct the brancher but when computing a choice.
I have tried several ways to make both the brancher and the shared_pointer
happy with their respective requirements. However I have found myself in
the following situation.

When I add the shared_pointer as an attribute to the brancher I get the
shared pointer reference counter messed up. The reason is that the brancher
does not actually have a destructor and hence the shared_pointer counter is
never decremented and the owned pointer is never destructed at the end of
the solver execution. I tried to explicitly call the destructor of the
shared pointer in the dispose method of the brancher. However, it seems
that the brancher gets copied more times than the dispose method is called.

Is there a way to integrate both approaches smoothly?. Probably I am
overlooking something.

Regards,
Gustavo

Hi Gustavo,

did you register the brancher for disposal?  It's described in sect. 19.4 in MPG, have a look at the way home.notice() is called for the brancher in the example.

Message-ID: <B4393451-A717-447D-A3E2-8959C33D18CC@it.uu.se>

Hello,

I have a quick question about a propagator with heap-allocated memory. I understand that it needs to be registered for disposal, via AP_DISPOSE. But I?m a little confused by the ?Reporting allocated memory? paragraph in MPG (Section 30.2, p. 361), which states that any propagator allocating non-space memory ?must implement the virtual member function allocated()?.

I?ve looked, but it seems like the allocated() member function has been removed (maybe as part of the change to peak memory tracking in 4.2?). Is it safe to assume this paragraph no longer applies? Or do I need to report the propagator?s allocated size somewhere else?

Thanks!
Joe

Message-ID: <CAPigQke6ByQu7Uxo4BQdEJBgZfx_4oFT+9hGQ7mOkpsBkWY_LQ@mail.gmail.com>

Hello,
I have an array of size 100.
I have some constraints that I implemented for that array but they are not
big constraints, which means there are a lot of solutions for the problem.

I have issues with the branching. Basically what I want is to have the
biggest diversity for the values at 2 levels :
- biggest diversity within the same gecode generation (which would mean,
use the maximum range for each variable)
- biggest diversity between 2 gecode generations (I would like to have
completely different results with the same problem if I solve it again with
gecode).

For now, only
*branch(*this, myArray, INT_VAR_RND(r), INT_VAL_RND(r));*
has given me good results but it takes ages to compute for a simple problem.
I have tried some of the other branching options but its very regular
solution and almost the same between 2 generations .

Would you have some ideas to achieve that?
Cheers,
Richard

Subject: [gecode-users] Feasibility of using Gecode for non-linear
	optimization problem
Message-ID: <D63A33CAB1564E7381EAFA49C6FDE777@ALCHEMY>

Dear all,
   
    I have used Gecode in the past and I am considering it now to solve an optimization problem but I am not so sure about the feasibility.
    I would like your expert advise before starting a lot of coding that may not come to any good conclusion.

    The problem has around 40 parameters(floats bounded ?20% to 20% let?s say) to be optimized( minimize or maximize, depending the case). The evaluation of the function to obtain the value takes 12 sec to be executed in the available environment ( no parallelization in place )
    The problem applies the 40 parameters that, can be seen as weights, to the data and obtains a list of one thousand values one for each subject in the study.
    The list of is sorted by the value of the variable calculated.
    The objective is to minimize the value of the element in the nth position (fixed) once sorted but the parameters change which element(subject) goes to the nth position.

    In addition there are other variables that are depending on the same set of 40 parameters, and that act as constraints: i.e. the value can not go beyond or below a certain limit. But the relationship is linear or quadratic on the parameters so I know this is easy for Gecode.

     The problem is on the first part of the problem, where I don?t see how to express the constraint.
     Any hints on how to approach that problem would be appreciated.
     I am in parallel evaluating changing the problem to be solved and try to optimize instead the sum of the one thousand values what I think would simplify the problem, and make it much faster. Would that make the problem solvable with Gecode?

      The problem being feasible, the second point is about viability. Taking each computation 12 secs, the computation can be dramatically slow. Where should I look at, in the documentation, for ways to improve speed?

         Thanks in advance

Subject: [gecode-users] multi-dimensional bin-packing constraint - bin
	capacities
Message-ID: <546A35DD.8030309@cisco.com>

Hi,

I am updating ECLiPSe's Gecode interface to Gecode 4.3, and I am adding 
support for the multi-dimensional bin-packing constraint.

I have a small question about the arguments for the constraint:

binpacking(home, d, l, b, s, c)

has the capacities argument c that is not found in the 1-D bin-packing 
constraint:

binpacking(home, l, b, s)

My understanding is that for this form of the constraint, c is 
implicitly specified by l, the loads, i.e. the domains of each bin is 
specified by the domain in the load variable for that bin.

It seems to me that the values for c is also implicitly specified for 
the multi-dimensional case, and can be derived from l, as the maximum 
domain value of all the variables in l for each dimension. I am thinking 
of providing the constraint in this form so that it looks more like the 
1-D version. Does this make sense?

Cheers,

Kish

Hi Kish,

Yes, when I added this I thought exactly the same. However, I decided to
include the c argument to avoid confusion: the values of c (or as you say
the upper bound on the load variables) actually defines how well the
constraint is propagated. So what I tried to avoid by including c is that
users first post the binpacking constraint and only then adjust the load
variables...

I know, matter of taste.

Cheers
Christian

At the beginning of each run, you might compute one random permutation of
your variables, store in some std::map<IntVar,int> the place of each
variable in the permutation, and return that value as a merit function for
INT_VAR_MERIT_MIN; a constant value should be much cheaper than generating
random numbers each time.
You can do the same with values, value functions and INT_VAL, but in that
case a randomly chosen hash function might be cheaper than a lookup table.

Hi Conrad,

 

No, MPG does not have anything on this as minimodel is not meant to be
programmable or extensible.

 

The way how to do it is simple: consider making your propagator a
contribution to Gecode and we will help you doing the minimodel stuff.

 

Cheers

Christian

Subject: [gecode-users] Custom propagator in MiniModel

 

Hello,

 

assume I have written some propagator (as well as a reified version
thereof). Could you point me towards making that available for usage in
MiniModel?s BoolExprs, if that is possible at all? I don?t think MPG has
anything on this.

 

Cheers,

Conrad
