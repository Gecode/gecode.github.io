Subject: [gecode-users] Combination of symmetries in LDSB.
Message-ID: <1412156331.72599.YahooMailNeo@web171404.mail.ir2.yahoo.com>

Hi,
I have a question please about combination of symmetries:
suppose th probleme have the symmetric groupe: Gn = Dn*Z2. 
for example: 
- Dn: Consist on n rotation of rows of a Matrix  and n  permutations of specified rows or specified columns of the Matrix .
and
- Z2 = {id, rev}= {+1, -1}. id = +1, rev = -1./ 
rev represent the possibility of reflection of columns of the Matrix. 
So my question is: How to do this combinaition ? how to post the combinaition of this 3 forms of symmetries in the branch function, i must post each one independently or i post them in the same time ?. it means in general, how to post this the combinaition of these forms of symmetries:
examples: 
combination of this form:     Combination A = (Sym a + Sym b).
or combination of this form:  Combination B = (Sym a * Sym b).
I hope that my question is clear.
Thank you,

Cordially.

Yes, this should have the same effect as columns_reflect, but there are
a couple of problems with your code above.  The second argument to
VariableSequenceSymmetry should be the length of each sequence, not the
total length (in your example above, it should be
(opt.cols/2)*opt.rows).  Also, the bounds on your loops look wrong; I
think they should be:

  for (int i = 0 ; i < (opt.cols/2); i++) 
and
  for (int i = (opt.cols-1) ; i >= (opt.cols+1)/2 ; i--)


As for the second question, you can post a combination of symmetries by
adding another symmetry definition to the Symmetries object, e.g. in
the bibd example:

      Symmetries s;
      s << rows_interchange(p);
      s << columns_interchange(p);

The effect is that each symmetry is applied until a fixed point is
reached.  For example, if value "v" is deleted from the domain of the
variable p(1,1) by search, then according to the rows-interchange
symmetry "v" will be removed from p(1,2), p(1,3), p(1,4), etc.  Then
because "v" has been deleted from p(1,2), according to the column
symmetry "v" will be deleted from p(2,2), p(3,2), p(4,2), etc.  This
continues until there are no more values to delete due to symmetry.

This effect is an approximation of taking the product of the two
symmetry groups.  It's not possible to have each symmetry definition
act independently of the others, if that's what you mean by "Sym a +
Sym b".

Thank you Mr Mears, 
If I understand correctly, to execute the combination of symmetries I must to add all the relevant declarations of symmetries to the same object Symmetries s. 
and the execution of the combination is done sequentially, So, we have the execution of the first decalaration symmetry is done and next the second definition of symmetry is executed ...etc, but they do not run in parrallel. 

So to apply the combination of the following symmetric group: 
Gn = { sym 1: 'interchangeability of specified rows' + sym 2: 'interchangeability of specified columns' + sym 3: 'rotation of rows'} * { symmetry identity, sym 4: 'reflections of columns of a matrix' }.
I have to execute the following pseudo code: ( post all definitions of symmetries to the same object s )
Symmetries s;
s << declaration_of_sym 1;
branch (......,sym 1, ....);
s << declaration_of_sym 2;
branch (....., sym 2, ....);
s << declaration_of_sym 3;
branch (....., sym 3, ....);

s << declaration_of_sym 4;
branch (....., sym 4, ....);

thank you sir,
Best regards. sabrina.

Each symmetry is processed separately, but they are re-run repeatedly
until there is no more work to be done.  In this sense they operate
similarly to constraint propagators.

For your example, I cannot see how posting multiple branchers over the
same variables will do what you want.  I suggest that you put all the
symmetry definitions into one Symmetries object, pass that to a single
call to "branch", and see if that gives you the right behaviour.

Hi,

I am new to gecode and I have a simple question.

I am trying to find one possible solution for the following system:

1A + 1B >  0
1A + 0B >  0
1A + 1B >  0
0A + 0B <= 0

Obviously, there are many solutions. For instance, A=1 and B=1.

My code is the following:

class SolverSpace : public Gecode::Space
{
   IntVarArray s;

public:
   SolverSpace() :
     s(*this, 2, -1000000, 1000000) // lots of possible values, to be on 
the safe side
   {
     { // 1A + 1B >  0
       IntArgs coeffs(2); coeffs[0] = 1;  coeffs[1] = 1;
       linear(*this, coeffs, s, IRT_GT, int(0));
     }
     { // 1A + 0B >  0
       IntArgs coeffs(2); coeffs[0] = 1;  coeffs[1] = 0;
       linear(*this, coeffs, s, IRT_GT, int(0));
     }
     { // 1A + 1B >  0
       IntArgs coeffs(2); coeffs[0] = 0;  coeffs[1] = 1;
       linear(*this, coeffs, s, IRT_GT, int(0));
     }
     { // 0A + 0B <= 0
       IntArgs coeffs(2); coeffs[0] = 0;  coeffs[1] = 0;
       linear(*this, coeffs, s, IRT_LE, int(0));
     }

     branch(*this, s, INT_VAR_SIZE_MIN(), INT_VAL_MIN());
   }

   SolverSpace(bool share, SolverSpace& e) :
     Gecode::Space(share, e)
   {
     s.update(*this, share, e.s);
   }

   virtual Space *copy(bool share)
   {
     return new SolverSpace(share, *this);
   }

   void print()
   {
     for (int i = 0; i < 2; i++)
       std::cout << s[i] << ", ";
     std::cout << std::endl;
   }
}

Calling code:

SolverSpace*m = new SolverSpace();
DFS<SolverSpace> e(m);
delete m;
if (SolverSpace *s = e.next()) {
   s->print(); delete s;
}

To my surprise, no solution is found. What am I doing wrong?

Thank you,

Fred

I am not sure how you got this to compile, because this should be
"IRT_GR".

Here you want IRT_LQ ( <= ) instead of IRT_LE ( < ).

I changed IRT_LE for IRT_LQ and it works, thank you. I'm silly, if 
coefficients are all zeros, it helps if the right hand size can also be 
zero!

Just a tip: please read Sections 3.1 and 7.1 in MPG. It shows how to write
normal C++ expressions for posting linear constraints.

Hi Vijay,

Not being an Apple user, let me still try a guess: you need to add
additional libraries:
 -lgecodeminimodel -lgecodedriver -lgecodegist

Please use the order as described in MPG.

Good luck
Christian

Subject: [gecode-users] Compilation problem on MacOs with Gecode 4.3

Continuing with http://www.gecode.org/pipermail/users/2014-April/004368.html

I am unable to get the basic example running from the tutorial.

On a MacBook, OS X 10.9.2, XCode 5.1.1, trying to install GECode 4.3 from
the webpage http://www.gecode.org/download.html

Downloaded source package, did a ./configure, make, make-install -- all
seemed to succeed.

The following command succeeds:

$g++ -O3 -I/usr/local/include -stdlib=libstdc++ -c money.cpp

However, the next command fails -- what am I doing wrong?

Apparently you did compile with Gist, that explains the first thing.

The second I do not know and I will have to leave to an Apple user...

Subject: [gecode-users] Compilation problem on MacOs with Gecode 4.3
In-Reply-To: <009a01cfe6f7$fc2c8380$f4858a80$@se>

FWIW, I did "make test", and ran test/test, and all tests pass.

I am also able to run the examples.

So in principle I could decode the make file for the examples and tests 
and find out what to do :-)

FWIW for others who might be in a similar predicament: Cutting and 
pasting from the log files for make test yielded the following commands 
that worked to compile and run my code:

Hi Vijay,

the main difference seems to be that you had -stdlib=libstdc++ on your command line.  The missing symbols were probably mismatches on std::ostream (all the linker errors referenced that symbol), so I guess that you compiled Gecode with libc++ but later tried to compile your example with libstdc++?  In particular if you link against Qt, you have to use the same standard library that was used to compile Qt.

Cheers,
Guido

Hi Guido --

I had the -stdlib=libstdc++ line in there only because you had suggested 
that it be so in 
http://www.gecode.org/pipermail/users/2014-April/004368.html :-)

So I went back and redid everything without Qt, to see what I would get.

This time I was able to get the following to work. So perhaps I had just 
gotten myself confused earlier... Any case, glad to have it working now! 
(Note: unlike what the manual said, I did need to include the 
-I/usr/local/include arg.)

  g++ -I/usr/local/include -O3  -c -o money.o  money.cpp
bash-3.2$ g++ -o money money.o -L/usr/local/lib    -O3 -lgecodeflatzinc 
-lgecodedriver  -lgecodesearch -lgecodeminimodel -lgecodeset 
-lgecodefloat -lgecodeint -lgecodekernel -lgecodesupport
bash-3.2$ ./money
SEND+MORE=MONEY
     {9, 5, 6, 7, 1, 0, 8, 2}

Initial
     propagators: 2
     branchers:   1

Summary
     runtime:      0.000 (0.252 ms)
     solutions:    1
     propagations: 14
     nodes:        7
     failures:     3
     restarts:     0
     no-goods:     0
     peak depth:   1

bash-3.2$

Subject: [gecode-users] Setup problems with 4.3.0 on OS X
Message-ID: <CAEEmEPqqX+VNMnryXtF-OKoGWqPOh=806OOdB2Wnf=J1sJa6qg@mail.gmail.com>

Hello,

I'm trying to compile examples from Gecode 4.3.0 on a Mac OS X (Mavericks
10.9.5) with  g++ (Apple LLVM version 6.0 (clang-600.0.51) (based on LLVM
3.5svn) Target: x86_64-apple-darwin13.4.0).

I started with the simplest route, i.e download the 4.3.0 dmg file which
according to the site contains everything needed (including Qt libs).

Then, following the 'Modeling and Programming with Gecode' installation
instructions for Apple Mac OS issued a:

  g++ -O3 -c money.cpp

so far, so good. Followed this with a

g++ -framework gecode -o money money.cpp			

At this point the linker got angry and threw this at me:

  -----------------

Undefined symbols for architecture x86_64:

  "Gecode::Gist::TextOutput::TextOutput(std::__1::basic_string<char,
std::__1::char_traits<char>, std::__1::allocator<char> > const&)",
referenced from:

      void Gecode::Driver::ScriptBase<Gecode::Space>::runMeta<Money,
Gecode::DFS, Gecode::Options, Gecode::Driver::EngineToMeta>(Gecode::Options
const&, Money*) in money.o

      void Gecode::Driver::ScriptBase<Gecode::Space>::runMeta<Money,
Gecode::DFS, Gecode::Options, Gecode::RBS>(Gecode::Options const&, Money*)
in money.o

  "Gecode::Driver::stop(Gecode::Support::Timer&,
std::__1::basic_ostream<char, std::__1::char_traits<char> >&)", referenced
from:

      void Gecode::Driver::ScriptBase<Gecode::Space>::runMeta<Money,
Gecode::DFS, Gecode::Options, Gecode::Driver::EngineToMeta>(Gecode::Options
const&, Money*) in money.o

      void Gecode::Driver::ScriptBase<Gecode::Space>::runMeta<Money,
Gecode::DFS, Gecode::Options, Gecode::RBS>(Gecode::Options const&, Money*)
in money.o

  "Gecode::branch(Gecode::Home, Gecode::IntVarArgs const&,
Gecode::IntVarBranch, Gecode::IntValBranch, bool (*)(Gecode::Space const&,
Gecode::IntVar, int), void (*)(Gecode::Space const&, Gecode::BrancherHandle
const&, unsigned int, Gecode::IntVar, int, int const&,
std::__1::basic_ostream<char, std::__1::char_traits<char> >&))", referenced
from:

      Money::Money(Gecode::Options const&) in money.o

ld: symbol(s) not found for architecture x86_64

-----------------

Suspecting this is Qt related, I tried various things including compiling
from XCode but to no avail, so at this point decided to try building it
from the sources.

At first I tried the ./configure, make path but after compiling a few files
this failed with compilation error due to not finding some header file of
Qt (I don't recall which now), though I have the latest Qt SDK installed.

So I decided to try the cmake route. Here, the compilation completed with
no errors. I then ollowed the last thread about problems compiling 4.3.0 on
OS/X and used the following to link:

g++ -o money money.o -L/Users/amnondavid/Downloads/gecode-4.3.0/ -O3
-lgecodeflatzinc -lgecodedriver  -lgecodesearch -lgecodeminimodel
-lgecodeset -lgecodefloat -lgecodeint -lgecodekernel -lgecodesupport
but again, received a set of linking errors starting with:

  "Gecode::Gist::Comparator::~Comparator()", referenced from:

      void Gecode::Driver::ScriptBase<Gecode::Space>::runMeta<Money,
Gecode::DFS, Gecode::Options,
Gecode::Driver::EngineToMeta>(Gecode::Options const&, Money*) in
money.o

      void Gecode::Driver::ScriptBase<Gecode::Space>::runMeta<Money,
Gecode::DFS, Gecode::Options, Gecode::RBS>(Gecode::Options const&,
Money*) in money.o

      Gecode::Gist::VarComparator<Money>::~VarComparator() in money.o

      non-virtual thunk to
Gecode::Gist::VarComparator<Money>::~VarComparator() in money.o

      Gecode::Gist::VarComparator<Money>::~VarComparator() in money.o

      non-virtual thunk to
Gecode::Gist::VarComparator<Money>::~VarComparator() in money.o

  "Gecode::Gist::TextOutput::init()", referenced from:

      Gecode::Gist::VarComparator<Money>::compare(Gecode::Space
const&, Gecode::Space const&) in money.o

      Gecode::Gist::Print<Money>::inspect(Gecode::Space const&) in money.o

I figured what is needed is adding -lgecodegist, but looking at the
generated libraries, I noticed the cmake process didn't generate it. Again,
I assume due to not finding Qt (although I have the libraries installed).

Having installed Gecode on my Mac a couple of years ago and doing some cool
things with it , I'd like to get the latest version, though instead of
spending a few more hours (or days) tracking this down, perhaps one of the
gurus here could solve it in 5 minutes...

Thanks,

Amnon

Hi,

this seems to be (yet another) problem with the two different standard C++ libraries on Mac OS X.  When using the binary package, the following should work:

g++ -F/Library/Frameworks -stdlib=libstdc++ -o money money.cpp -framework gecode

(tested with the same configuration as yours)

I'm not sure what happens in your second example, where cmake doesn't find Qt.  In that case it should actually set (or unset) a preprocessor macro so that e.g. the driver does not contain any reference to Qt/Gist.  I'll have to check that.

Cheers,
Guido

Message-ID: <CAPigQkcFTy=7OQBUT-Mt8sNAjLj2cZ3HSW_9D+e9oBvpJ98ERw@mail.gmail.com>

Hello,
I have an array (size 10) of positive integers which can also take the
value 0;
I have a constraint on the sum of these numbers for example 10;
Here is a solution for example :
1 2 0 0 5 1 0 0 0 1
I want to add a constraint : the sum of the 2 first integers with value
different to 0 equals 4.
How could I do that?
Cheers,
Richard

Perfect. Worked like a charm :)

Hi,

 

This is not really a Gecode question but a modeling question. This group should be really focused on Gecode.

Subject: [gecode-users] Question about one type of constraint

 

Hello,

I have an array (size 10) of positive integers which can also take the value 0;

I have a constraint on the sum of these numbers for example 10;

Here is a solution for example :

1 2 0 0 5 1 0 0 0 1

I want to add a constraint : the sum of the 2 first integers with value different to 0 equals 4.

How could I do that?

Cheers,

Richard

Fair enough, can u recommend a list where modeling questions like this 
can be asked?

I just had a discussion that it might be a good idea to create a forum for general modeling questions in constraint programming. The OR community does that.

 

I will contact the Association of Constraint Programming whether this is something that they would like to take on as a development activity.

Sorry, Christian, to use the Gecode list for this but...

OR-Exchange (https://www.or-exchange.org/) has sometimes questions 
related to CP.
Depending on whether one believes CP is part of OR or not, it might or 
might not be a good idea to create a parallel forum.
In the meantime, Richard, you might ask your question there and see if 
you get any answer...

Best,

Jean-No?l

Message-ID: <331F0762-ADBA-48A0-81B5-0D4BF85F02C2@it.uu.se>

Hi all,

Kellen Dye has written a Gecode implementation of bit-vector variables and propagators for bit-vector constraints, including some of those of [MVH12], following the ideas of that paper.  The C++ source files and a benchmark are at https://github.com/kellen/bitvector-masters/ .  The implementation is provided as is, and does not fully comply yet with Gecode style, but we hope it will already be useful to some.

Cheers,
Pierre

Hi everbody!

As Pierre wrote, the code available at:
https://github.com/kellen/bitvector-masters
is a result of my master's thesis in Computer Science with Pierre and
Jean-No?l Monette at Uppsala University. 

If there is interest, I would be willing to do the work to make the code
conform with Gecode style/convention/optimizations. I am, however, a relative
novice C++ coder, as I have mostly been employed doing python and java. 

There are some obvious improvements to be made to the code, some of which are
detailed in my thesis, and probably other potential improvements which will be
obvious to more seasoned C++/Gecode users. 

Christian/Guido: please let me know if/how I should go about integrating the
variable implementation into Gecode core.

Cheers,
Kellen

Hi,I want to use "alldifferent" constraint or a "distinct" constraint but in my case, i have a matrix M and i would that the elements (values) of the row of a matrix be different, but the variables of the row can have positive and negative values, so i would have a constraint that for example: if row = 1?then?the absolute values of M[1, j] could be all different, that means, if i have M[1,1]=(-3), i should not get M[1,j] =(+3) for j =1 to n.
alldifferent (|M[i, j]|).
My question is how to write this constraint in Gecode ?.Best regards. Sabrina?

Dear Kellen,

Yes, I think that would be interesting. However, I word of warning: while
the stuff that remains to do is all easy, it might actually take some time
to get the stuff ready so that we could accept it as a contribution.

What remains to be done is (I am not 100% whether you might already have
done part of it):
 - Each file must be under the Gecode license. Easy: just add the standard
header with your name to each file.
 - The structure of the contribution should be the same as for the other
variable types in Gecode (files, folders, file extensions, includes,
namespaces, no using clauses apart from individual functions, etc). Easy:
just have a look at any of the variable types that come with Gecode.
 - The set of branchers must be the same as for the other variable types to
get a uniform interface. Easy: just cut and paste will do (beware that you
have to retain the original licenses when you do stuff like this).
 - The set of propagators must be sufficiently complete to be useful.
 - We need some examples that use the variables.
 - We need tests! Here again, the easiest is to start from the tests for
some other variable type in Gecode.

Some of the things sound like we are nitpickers. We are as we have to be:
after all, when we accept a contribution we promise that we will try to keep
it alive (unless we find out later that nobody wants it).

The good news is, we are physically close. If you want to visit me in Kista
after you thought the stuff through and have a draft of your contribution
you are more than welcome. I'd even buy lunch ;-)

Cheers
Christian

Oh, then there is one more thing which I think you did not do: for bit
vectors support for modelling such as for integer variables (|, &, etc)
would be cool.

It can also be done by cut-and-paste but might be a bit harder.

Anyway, consider coming over.

Subject: [gecode-users] Segmentation Fault with fzn-gecode
Message-ID: <544A376C.50004@it.uu.se>

Hi,

I get a Segmentation Fault with the fzn-gecode compiled with Gecode 
4.3.1 when running, for instance, the file 
"minizinc-1.6/tests/evaluation/flatzinc/queens4.fzn" from the official 
MiniZinc distribution. Some other files (I only checked 
"minizinc-1.6/tests/evaluation/flatzinc/bool_clause.fzn") work fine.

I am running Linux Mint 17 on 64 bits but I know that Pierre Flener has 
also encountered the bug on his Mac (don't know the exact version) with 
different FlatZinc models. I did "./configure", "make", and "make 
install" without any arguments.

Cheers,

Jean-No?l

Hi,

thanks for the bug report.  Unfortunately the flatzinc interpreter wasn't tested enough and has a major bug.  It's (hopefully) fixed in the svn now, but I'll have to do some thorough testing next week.  For the time being, I've put up a notice to downgrade to 4.2.1 or upgrade to the svn trunk for a working FlatZinc.

Sorry for wasting everybody's time...

Cheers,
Guido

Hi,
I want to use "alldifferent" constraint or a "distinct" constraint but in my case, i have a matrix M and i would that the elements (values) of the row of a matrix be different, but the variables of the row can have positive and negative values, so i would have a constraint that for example:?
if row = 1?then?the absolute values of M[1, j] could be all different, that means, if i have M[1,1]=(-3), i should not get M[1,j] =(+3) for j =1 to n. so in the same row or in the same column if i have (val) i must not have (-val) or if i have (-val) i mast not have (val).
alldifferent (|M[i, j]|).
My question is how to write this constraint in Gecode ?.I hope my question was clear.

Best regards. Sabrina

It should be possible to define an absolute value view on an integer 
variable, and specify allDifferent on an array of such views. Don't yet 
know enough about the specific syntax in Gecode to help you, but others 
on this list will...

Hi,

to model this kind of constraint in Gecode you need to decompose it, i.e., you create an auxiliary matrix M' and post the constraints M'[i,j] = abs(M[i,j]), and then post the distinct constraints on M'.

Views, as suggested by Vijay, can't be used for modelling in Gecode, only for implementing your own propagator.

Cheers,
Guido

You need to use reification to express if-then-else.  E.g. if for the constraint if b then c1 else c2 you need to essentially implement "b implies c1" and "not b implies c2". Reification is explained in the documentation.

The principle and inner workings of LDSB are described in this paper:

Christopher Mears, Maria Garcia de la Banda, Bart Demoen, Mark Wallace.
Constraints 19(3), pp. 195-242. 2014.

You can get a copy from Springer

For LDSB there's no difference between DFS and branch-and-bound.  LDSB
adds some extra constraints at certain choice points; it doesn't
interact directly with the solver engine (DFS/BAB).  In the Gecode
sense, it's just a special kind of Brancher.

Hi,
I want to write a program in Gecode for tow types of instances: the constrained instances (where all constraints must be satisfied) and the unconstrained instances (where one constraint or more can be not satisfied if the solution is optimal).
The question is how th do for the second type of constraint. ie, not necessarly all constraints be satisfied. ( ie, if exists an operator like "OR" to write between constraints or how to do ?).
Thank you in advance.Best regards.

Dear Sabrina,

 

As has been discussed recently on the mailing list, this list is really reserved for Gecode-specific issues and not general modeling questions. Please do respect this policy.

 

Best

Subject: [gecode-users] Constraints in Gecode for unconstrained instances.

 

Hi,

 

I want to write a program in Gecode for tow types of instances: the constrained instances (where all constraints must be satisfied) and the unconstrained instances (where one constraint or more can be not satisfied if the solution is optimal).

 

The question is how th do for the second type of constraint. ie, not necessarly all constraints be satisfied. ( ie, if exists an operator like "OR" to write between constraints or how to do ?).

 

Thank you in advance.

Best regards.
