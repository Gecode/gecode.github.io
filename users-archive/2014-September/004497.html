<PRE>Hi,

 

The setup is that a script must be a sub-class of Gecode::Space. However,
you can pass these objects around, so I do not really see where the problem
is, sorry. 

 

Cheers

Christian

Subject: [gecode-users] Creating a function to solve CP sub-problem
instances

 

Hi,

 

I'm trying to implement a tabu search algorithm that involves solving small
constraint programming sub-problems. Firstly, I used the examples found in
the Modelling and Programming Guide to develop a script to solve an instance
of a sub-problem. Now, I'm looking to expand upon this by creating a
function that consumes data to solve a sub-problem, solve it using Gecode,
and then return an optimal solution to the sub-problem in a some data
structure.

 

I'm having problems trying to turn my script into a callable function. Given
from what I've seen in the guide, it seems like it is not possible, or it's
taken as something trivial and is not glossed over, as I haven't found any
similar examples after searching on-line. What I started to do was play
around with the print function (same layout as in the SEND MOST MONEY
examples in the guide) and try replacing it with a function that interprets
the solution, but I've had no luck.

 

One could classify my experience with Gecode and C++ as very beginner (I
picked up C++ so I could use Gecode's capabilities), so I apologize if this
question comes off as ignorant or out of scope. Any help would be greatly
appreciated.

 

Cheers,

Nathan
