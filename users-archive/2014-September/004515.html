<PRE>Hi Andrea,

 

What you have to do is two things, basically:

1. (as mentioned) implement a brancher yourself.

2. Information that is expensive (oe even impossible)  to re-compute you should store in  a subclass of Choice that you yourself can define. I think Chapter 19 (Section 19.4) is a nice example: there the brancher also does symmetry-breaking during search and it stores all symmetry information explicitly.

 

Cheers

Christian

I'm sorry for multiple replies, but I want to ask this in a more general fashion.

 

Consider I planned to perform a quite burdensome heuristic in a particular point of the search (that's why I'm splitting the search).

Obviously this heuristics helps to prune the search space.

How can I be sure that this heuristic is not recomputed more and more?

 

Thanks,

Andrea Peano

You can disable recomputation but this is not a good idea as it degrades performance seriously and increases memory consumption considerably.

Yes, I see.

 

 

What you could do (also not good) is call status() yourself.

I'm already doing it, but this does not seem enough to prevent recomputation on those nodes. I call it within second_level and third_level but it's not enough. Do you mean somewhere else?

 

 

The real (but tough) thing to do is to implement your own brancher. 

 

And just checking: do you know that multiple branchers are executed in the order they are created? But maybe that is not enough for you.

Yes, I know, I tried to make the search as simple as possible, but there are some aspects of the problem a bit difficult to manage.

Anyway, I'll find a way.

 

Thanks for giving me a halping hand.

 

Andrea

I was just reading on the Gecode guide that this behaviour is due to the &quot;recomputation&quot;.

So I have two more questions: can I completely prevent this behaviour by disabling recomputation?

Has recomputation a direct effect on parallel search?

 

Thanks,

Andrea

Hello,

 

I've implemented a search strategy by splitting the search into three levels. I think the code may explain better this strategy.

 

 

void MyModel::post(Space&amp; home)

{

static_cast&lt;MyModel&amp;&gt;(home).second_level();

}

 

void MyModel::second_level()

{

status();

 

//do something with the partial solution
//print &quot;second level&quot;

branch(*this, BoolBranchDirection, INT_VAL_MIN());

branch(*this, post2);

}

 

void MyModel::post2(Space&amp; home)

{

static_cast&lt;MyModel&amp;&gt;(home).third_level();

}

 

void MyModel::third_level()

{

if(BoolBranchDirection.val()==0)
{
//print third level left
//left branch behaviour (install further branches)
}
else
{
//print third level right
//right branch behaviour (install further branches)
}

}

 

Imagine now we are fixing the partial solution before the &quot;post&quot; calling, so the solver goes only once into the &quot;post&quot; function (and it's confirmed by GIST).

 

The strange fact is that &quot;second_level&quot; is called more than once! Instead I expect one call for &quot;second_level&quot; and two calls for &quot;third_level&quot;, which executes two different paths of the code.

 

These are the prints I read:

second level

third level left

second level

third level right

second level

third level right

 

But I expected:

second level

third level left

third level right

 

Can you clarify this behaviour please?

 

Furthermore, I experienced that I need to call &quot;status()&quot; within the second level, to ground some variables I expected to be already ground. Is this normal?

 

I'm using Gecode 4.2.1

 

Thanks,

Andrea
