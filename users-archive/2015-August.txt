Subject: [gecode-users] bin_packing with 0 item sizes
Message-ID: <55C4F222.8090602@cisco.com>

Hi,

In writing unit tests for ECLiPSe's Gecode interface, I noticed that for 
the bin packing constraint, if an item size is 0, then its corresponding 
bin variable is not constrained:

binpacking(home, l, b, s) where

b = {b1, b2}

s = {0, 1}

then b2 is constrained to [0,1], but b1's domain is not constrained 
(i.e. has whatever the domain it was given).

Cheers,

Kish

Subject: [gecode-users] multi-dimensional binpacking gives fatal signal 11
Message-ID: <55C894E6.8060405@cisco.com>

Hi,

I am gettng a fatal signal 11 (on Linux, Gecode 4.4.0) with the 
multi-dimensional binpacking for some arguments values. The simplest 
case that I can generate the problem is:

binpacking(home, 2, l, b, s, c)

l = {0, 0, l1, l2} (0 is where the IntVar has a singleton domain of 0)
b = {0, b1}
s = {0,0,0,0}
c = {5,5}

The binpacking constraint is called from ECLiPSe, and some of the 
arguments are generated. I haven't tried to call binpacking 
independently of ECLiPSe, but it does look like the problem is happening 
in Gecode: valgrind (a memory checker) detected the first problem in

BinPacking::Pack::post(...)

which is called by binpacking

with a Conditional jump or move depends on uninitialised value(s)

(Sorry, I don't know how to cut and paste from my xterm window in a VNC 
session to my Windows mailer).

The first message may not be a real error, but the next, also in the 
Pack::post function, does seem to be an error: Invalid red of size 4.

I haven't really written a stand-alone Gecode program, so I thought I 
should report this issue before trying to do so -- please let me know if 
you want me to do this.

Thanks and cheers,

Kish

I want to implement a propagator which rollbacks the integer when a

How can I do this in Gecode?

You don?t need it. Please read a little bit about Gecode works. It is based on copying and not reversible data structures. Christian

Hi Christian,

I assume it is the same problem, but just in case it isn't -- I also get 
crashes when not all the item sizes are zero, for example, for a 2D item 
with size {0,1} (so the sizes are {0,0,0,1} -- there is always a dummy 
0'th element).

Cheers,

Kish

Yes, it is. The problem is if the projection on one dimension had only zero

Subject: [gecode-users] ~Event nothrow issue
Message-ID: <mqsl7c$cbm$1@ger.gmane.org>

Hi,

I've tried compiling Gecode 4.4.0 with MSVC 2015 and it produces 
warnings about ~Event being (implicitly) nothrow but throwing exceptions 
at the same time.

I was thinking whether or not it is worth fixing in Gecode code, and 
found this nice explanation:

http://denisbider.blogspot.cz/2015/07/exceptions-in-destructors-and-visual.html

I believe either noexcept(false) (portable but probably C++11 only 
syntax) or throw(...) might help - possibly replacing "..." with 
something reasonable.

Cheers,
Filip

Hi Christian,

Cool, thanks.  Out of curiosity I looked in the SVN but I don't see the 
change in there yet, but maybe my repo browser is just too lazy today :)

Another useful link for those interested - I was trying to build a x64 
debug version with PDBs using the x64 command prompt + cygwin (with 
--enable-debug), but that failed due to a bug in MSVC leading to

LINK : fatal error LNK1101: incorrect MSPDB140.DLL version; recheck

Hi,

it looks like using boost::multi_index::member<> crashes MSVC 2015 RTM 
when a const-qualified type is passed to it as the 2nd argument, but the 
member is actually non-const.

#include <boost\multi_index_container.hpp>

using namespace boost::multi_index;
int main() {
   typedef multi_index_container<X, indexed_by<ordered_unique<member<X,

   C c;
   c.find(1); // C1001
   return 0;

Message-ID: <55DE05C4.9050906@cisco.com>

I am writing more unit tests for our Gecode interface, and for the 
circuit constraint (without costs), I would like to write tests for the 
supported propagation levels (ICL_DOM and ICL_VAL), and see some 
difference between the two levels, but I am unable to do so:

I tried with circuits with up to 7 nodes, and then assigning a value to 
one of the nodes. For both ICL_DOM and ICL_VAL, and both seem to produce 
the same domains for the variables. Is this expected? If so, what do I 
need to do to get a difference between the two propagations?

If the propagation is supposed to be different, this may indicate there 
is a problem in the interface and the constraint is not actually posted 
with the stated propagation levels...

Thanks and cheers,

Kish

Subject: [gecode-users] propagation consistency of count (single value)
	constraint
Message-ID: <55DE1FB2.90108@cisco.com>

I noticed an inconsistency in my (ECLiPSe) documentation for the count 
(for single values) constraint in the Gecode interface, and the current 
Gecode reference documentation for these constraints:

count(home, x, y, INT_EQ, z)

this is for IntVarArg x, while y and z can be int or IntVar

My documentation states that the constraint can be posted with ICL_DOM.
but this seems to be inconstent with the current reference documentation.

Looking at Gecode's reference documentation, it seems that depending on 
if y and z are int or IntVar, either the constraint is propagated at 
ICL_DEF only (not achieving domain consistency), or at two different 
consistency levels:

ICL_DOM, which does stronger propagation (but not domain consistent), 
and less propagation with all other IntConLev.

So if I understand the reference documentation correctly, ICL_DOM is 
used only to distinguish it from an alternative that perform less 
propagation (where the alternative exist, otherwise there is only one 
level of propagation). How does the propagation achived compared to 
bound and value consistencies?

I also noticed a minor typo in the reference documentation: in at least 
two places, domain is spelt as comain, as in 'propagation is not comain 
consistent'.

Cheers,

Kish

Nope, that's alright. The difference is how the distinct part of circuit is
enforced. Getting a difference in propagation is not that straightforward if
only using assignments (try to impose Hall sets and you will see the
difference).

Subject: [gecode-users] circuit constraint: differences between ICL_DOM and
ICL_VAL

I am writing more unit tests for our Gecode interface, and for the circuit
constraint (without costs), I would like to write tests for the supported
propagation levels (ICL_DOM and ICL_VAL), and see some difference between
the two levels, but I am unable to do so:

I tried with circuits with up to 7 nodes, and then assigning a value to one
of the nodes. For both ICL_DOM and ICL_VAL, and both seem to produce the
same domains for the variables. Is this expected? If so, what do I need to
do to get a difference between the two propagations?

If the propagation is supposed to be different, this may indicate there is a
problem in the interface and the constraint is not actually posted with the
stated propagation levels...

Thanks and cheers,

Kish

Hi,

It is better than value consistency and bounds consistency but for some
special cases not domain consistent.

Thanks for the error report, I fixed them.

Cheers
Christian

Subject: [gecode-users] propagation consistency of count (single value)
constraint

I noticed an inconsistency in my (ECLiPSe) documentation for the count (for
single values) constraint in the Gecode interface, and the current Gecode
reference documentation for these constraints:

count(home, x, y, INT_EQ, z)

this is for IntVarArg x, while y and z can be int or IntVar

My documentation states that the constraint can be posted with ICL_DOM.
but this seems to be inconstent with the current reference documentation.

As a follow up to my previous post on this, then from the reference 
documentation, for

count(home, x, y, IRT_EQ, z)

where y and z are int, then there is only one consistency level 
supported, and it is not domain consistent.

We have a rostering program (originally written for our ic solvder), 
which I used to test the Gecode interface, and it uses count 
constraints, and changing the consistency level affected the execution 
times significantly for certasin problem instances. I took a look again 
at the code, and the count constraints are with y and z being integers.
(the execution times are faster with ICL_BND than ICL_DOM)

The count single vsalue constraint is posted to Gecode using only one 
propagator, the version with y and z being IntVar (and if they are 
integers, they are posted as IntVar with a singleton domain). This is 
done for all constraints that have variants that accept both IntVar and 
int, as this avoid me having to write a lot of code to distinguish the 
argument types, and I remember asking about this here a while ago and I 
think Chirstian said that Gecode will figure out the best propagator to 
use for the argument.

So my questions are: is the propagator posted the one with y and z being 
int? If so, is there more than consistency level for the propagator, as 
my result seem to suggest? The difference is very significant, e.g. for 
one instance:

ICL_BND: 0.73s  ICL_DOM: 198s

the ICL_BND times are more than 100 times faster, and the only 
difference between the two runs are the count constraint posted with 
ICL_BND rather than ICL_DOM (running on the same machine, of course).


Cheers,

Kish

Subject: [gecode-users] Slow performance on large domains before branching
Message-ID: <55E3F840.7040909@uni-bremen.de>

Hello Developers and Users,
i have a quite big domain/searchspace.
However gecode performs currently well and solves my problem. But i 
recognized a strange behavior.

Berfore ma actual branching/search starts, gecodes does a lot of 
internal calculations. I'm not sure if i have done the setup wrong of if 
there is some optimization that i can do?
I attached [1] a picture of the most time and instruction consuming 
calls. Maybe somone can give me a recommendation where i can start tuning..

Setup (class instanciation and bracer setup ~15 sek)
first call of BAB until code-flow reaches my first (self written) 
brancher: ~3min
Actual branching/searching: 10sek.
Overall Memory consumption ~5GB

Best Regard,
Matthias
