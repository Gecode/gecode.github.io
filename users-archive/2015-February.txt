Hello!

What kind of a theoretical foundation -- mathematics, and computer
science -- is required for developing and using Gecode productively?

(My background: I graduated last summer; I majored in computer science
(algorithms), and the subject of my master's thesis was Ant colony
optimization and vehicle routing problem. Even though I didn't cover
it in my thesis, I came accross constraint programming and soon after
that Gecode came on my radar. I feel there are gaps in my mathematical
basis; hence the question.)

Thank you for your time.

Hi Tuomas,

I would say that in practice what you need is in the gecode documentation
or reachable from there. However, if you are interested in the mathematical
foundations of constraint programming (not only gecode) you can start by
the book of Apt titled Principles of Constraint Programming (
http://homepages.cwi.nl/~apt/books.html). Another one is the Handbook of
Constraint Programming which is a very good reference.

As you are asking for theoretical foundations I suggest you to have a look
at those books which are not gecode specific. However their contents will
get you in the right direction. If you are looking for seminal works I
would suggest you to look at
http://scholar.google.com/citations?user=yT1DBNsAAAAJ&hl=en&oi=sra

Again, none of them are directly related to gecode but describe its formal
foundations.

Cheers,
Gustavo

Subject: [gecode-users] Adding IntActivity to space
Message-ID: <54E2DE04.4040009@cisco.com>

Hi,

I am looking at using activity (IntActivity) when the search is done 
outside of Gecode to ECLiPSe's Gecode interface. I have added support 
for IntActivity when the search is done in Gecode, i.e. using a search 
engine, but I had thought I can't support IntActivity outside because 
IntActivity is declared with a fixed set of variables, while ECLiPSe can 
dynamically add variables to the problem.

However, the ECLiPSe interface does provide a predicate (procedure) that 
perform variable selection on a fixed set of variables, so I think 
IntActivity can be added as a selection method here -- an IntActivity 
can be declared for the set of variables being selected when the 
predicate is first called.

Does this IntActiviity have to be added to my space class? The activity 
applies globally, and is not specific to a space, but the IntActivity is 
declared with space as an argument along with variables for that space. 
If it needs to be added to the space (with a IntActivity* in the space, 
set to NULL if IntActivity is not used, I assume?) How should it be 
copied when the space is cloned?

Does this look like the right way to do it?

Thanks in advance!

Kish

Hi Kish,

Yes, that looks okay. You have to call update() on the activity object when
you clone a space.

Hi Tuomas,

 

Sorry for the delay, I was afk.

 

There is not much needed to get started with Constraint Programming, a CS degree is by far enough (I have educated quite a number of people in CP with less background knowledge than that). You can either follow the first two chapters in ?Modeling and Programming with Gecode? or you could consider starting CP with a modeling language such as MiniZinc:

                http://www.minizinc.org/

 

If you want to know about the foundations of Gecode you can check:

                http://www.csse.monash.edu/~guidot/dissertation.php

and

                http://www.gecode.org/~schulte/paper.html?id=SchulteStuckey:TOPLAS:2008

and also other papers here:

                http://www.gecode.org/publications.html

 

Cheers

Christian

Hi Christian,

Thanks for your reply.

So I guess there is no way of avoiding putting  the IntActivity into the 
space, even though I assume the activity information is stored in
one place for all the clones of that space?

One reason I would like to store the IntActivity separate from the space 
is that with the IntActivity in the space, I can only have one per 
branch of the search tree, so if I do more than one search in the same 
branch), I can use IntActivity for only one of the searches.

Cheers,

Kish

I guess I should expand on this -- I can get around this limitiation of 
one IntActivity per branch with a more elaborate data structure, such as 
an array or stack instead of a simple pointer, but I am not sure if it 
is worth the extra complexity for copying, deleting, using etc., for
a situation that I expect to be rare.

Message-ID: <SNT147-W74508B7E238EE83E7EA685F32A0@phx.gbl>

Hello,

I'm currently developing a solver for a problem using Gecode. Paradoxically, I have not encountered any problem for modeling and search solution. However I'm having trouble with symmetry breaking.

My problem is to place in a square array (n ? n) elements respecting some constraints. The peculiarity of my problem is that solutions are "toroidal". A concrete example:

Suppose that this arrangement is a solution (here n = 4):

+---+---+---+---+
| a | b | c | d |
+---+---+---+---+
| e | f | g | h |
+---+---+---+---+
| i | j | k | l |
+---+---+---+---+
| m | n | o | p |
+---+---+---+---+

So all these arrangements are symmetric solutions:

(By shifting the rows:)
+---+---+---+---+   +---+---+---+---+   +---+---+---+---+
| e | f | g | h |   | i | j | k | l |   | m | n | o | p |
+---------------+   +---------------+   +---------------+
| i | j | k | l |   | m | n | o | p |   | a | b | c | d |
+---------------+   +---------------+   +---------------+
| m | n | o | p |   | a | b | c | d |   | e | f | g | h |
+---------------+   +---------------+   +---------------+
| a | b | c | d |   | e | f | g | h |   | i | j | k | l |
+---+---+---+---+   +---+---+---+---+   +---+---+---+---+

(By shifting the columns:)
+---+---+---+---+   +---+---+---+---+   +---+---+---+---+
| b | c | d | a |   |?c?|?d?|?a?|?b?|   | d | a | b | c |
+---------------+   +---------------+   +---------------+
| f | g | h | e |   |?g?|?h?|?e?|?f?|   | h | e | f | g |
+---------------+   +---------------+   +---------------+
| j | k | l | i |   |?k?|?l?|?i?|?j?|   | l | i | j | k |
+---------------+   +---------------+   +---------------+
| n | o | p | m |   |?o?|?p?|?m?|?n?|   | p | m | n | o |
+---+---+---+---+   +---+---+---+---+   +---+---+---+---+

(By shifting rows and columns:)
+---+---+---+---+   +---+---+---+---+   +---+---+---+---+
| f | g | h | e |   | k | l | i | j |   | p | m | n | o |
+---------------+   +---------------+   +---------------+
| j | k | l | i |   | o | p | m | n |   | d | a | b | c |
+---------------+   +---------------+   +---------------+
| n | o | p | m |   | c | d | a | b |   | h | e | f | g |
+---------------+   +---------------+   +---------------+
| b | c | d | a |   | g | h | e | f |   | l | i | j | k |
+---+---+---+---+   +---+---+---+---+   +---+---+---+---+

This list is not exhaustive, the number of shifts on the rows or columns is arbitrary.

I know that this mailing list is not for general questions on constraint programming, and concerns specifically Gecode. And my problem is that I do not see how to implement symmetry breaking with Gecode.

I thought using LDSB (Lightweight Dynamic Symmetry Breaking), but after reading the documentation and examples, I'm not sure that this tool makes it possible to handle this case. From what I understand, LDSB manages permutations, defining variables (or values) that are interchangeable.

But in my case it is not "isolated" permutations (only one permutation does not give rise to a symmetry). So I do not how to use LDSB to manage shifts.

Similarly, I have not found a way to define constraints so as to break the symmetries. Of course, it is always possible to find all the solutions (symmetries included) and then detect and remove them, but the search space is much larger.

Hence my questions: is it possible to use LDSB to implement symmetry breaking "toroidal"? If not, is it possible to implement symmetry breaking "toroidal" in another way?

I can provide more information if necessary. Anyway, thanks for help.

Hi Christian,
I began implementing support for IntActivity outside of search engine, 
but I am unable to find from the documentation how to obtain the 
activity value for the variables in a IntActivity object. Is it possible 
to get these values?

I am not able to find this information from the MPG, and the IntActivity 
class reference documentation it points to, which seems to mainly 
describe how to use IntActivity with a search engine and the reference 
documentation describes only the init and = member functions.

A more general question: I seem to remember I ran into a similar problem 
before, where not all the member functions for a class is described in 
one place in the reference documentation. Is there anyway to find all 
the member functions available for a class?

Thanks and Cheers,

Kish

Hi Martin,

 

Maybe the following paper can help:

                Pierre Flener, Alan M. Frisch, Brahim Hnich, Zeynep Kiziltan, Ian Miguel, Justin Pearson, Toby Walsh:

Breaking Row and Column Symmetries in Matrix Models. CP 2002: 462-476

 

The idea is to use a lexical ordering constraint between rows and columns of a matrix to break some symmetries. See also the paragraph ?Lexicographic constraints between variable arrays.? in Section 4.4.3 in MPG.

 

Cheers

Christian

I thought using LDSB (Lightweight Dynamic Symmetry Breaking), but after reading the documentation and examples, I'm not sure that this tool makes it possible to handle this case. From what I understand, LDSB manages permutations, defining variables (or values) that are interchangeable.

But in my case it is not "isolated" permutations (only one permutation does not give rise to a symmetry). So I do not how to use LDSB to manage shifts.

Similarly, I have not found a way to define constraints so as to break the symmetries. Of course, it is always possible to find all the solutions (symmetries included) and then detect and remove them, but the search space is much larger.

Hence my questions: is it possible to use LDSB to implement symmetry breaking "toroidal"? If not, is it possible to implement symmetry breaking "toroidal" in another way?

I can provide more information if necessary. Anyway, thanks for help.

Hi Kish,

The activity value can be accessed by position. Suppose that you have
created
	IntActivity a(home, x);

Then a[i] is the activity of the variable x[i].

When you display a class in the reference documentation then there is a link
named "View all members" which then displays all members including those
which are inherited.

Cheers
Christian

Hi Christian,
I began implementing support for IntActivity outside of search engine, but I
am unable to find from the documentation how to obtain the activity value
for the variables in a IntActivity object. Is it possible to get these
values?

I am not able to find this information from the MPG, and the IntActivity
class reference documentation it points to, which seems to mainly describe
how to use IntActivity with a search engine and the reference documentation
describes only the init and = member functions.

A more general question: I seem to remember I ran into a similar problem
before, where not all the member functions for a class is described in one
place in the reference documentation. Is there anyway to find all the member
functions available for a class?

Thanks and Cheers,

Kish

Hello Martin,

You can use LDSB to break this symmetry, which is the composition of
two "cyclic" symmetries. If your variables are in a matrix "m":

    Symmetries syms;
    
    IntVarArgs rows;
    for (int r = 0; r < m.height(); r++)
      rows << m.row(r);
    for (int r = 0; r < m.height(); r++)
      rows << m.row((r+1) % m.height());
    syms << VariableSequenceSymmetry(rows, m.width()*m.height());

    IntVarArgs cols;
    for (int r = 0; r < m.width(); r++)
      cols << m.col(r);
    for (int r = 0; r < m.width(); r++)
      cols << m.col((r+1) % m.width());
    syms << VariableSequenceSymmetry(cols, m.width()*m.height());

The idea is that for the rows you have a variable sequence symmetry,
where the variables in the first sequence map to the corresponding
variables in the second one:

  a b c d e f g h i j k l m n o p
  e f g h i j k l m n o p a b c d

(i.e. a -> e, b -> f, etc.)

And similar for the columns.

Another way to break the symmetry, without LDSB, is to fix the position
of the smallest element; e.g. force the smallest element to be in the
top-left corner.  You can do this by posting constraints

  m(0,0) <= m(0,1)
  m(0,0) <= m(0,2)
  etc.

Are the variables in the square array constrained to be all different?
If so, you can strengthen those constraints into "strictly less than".
If they're all different and form a permutation (i.e. the number of
values in their domain is equal to the number of variables) then you
can simply fix the top-left variable to the smallest value;
e.g. "m(0,0) = 1".

Cheers,
Chris

Hi Christian,

Thanks for your help. I have now written the initial version of code 
that allow IntActivity to be used in the variable selection predicate of 
gfd. I have one question on what needs to be done during cloning, as you 
mentioned that update needs to be caled:

In my space class (GecodeSpace), the activity object, if it exist, is 
pointed to by an actp filed:

IntActivity* actp;

which is NULL otherwise.
In my space constructor used for cloning, the activity object is 
constructed using the copy constructor:

   GecodeSpace(bool share, GecodeSpace& s) : ....

   if (s.actp != NULL) {
	actp = new IntActivity(*(s.actp));

do I still need to call update in this case, i.e. something like:

         actp->update(*this, share, *(s.actp));

or does the copy constructor already does the copying needed?

Thanks and cheers,

Kish

Hi Kish,

Using both the constructor as well as update will not work (there is some
reference counting going on and then things will be counted twice!). I
checked, just using the constructor should work.

Cheers
Christian

Hi,

I hope you're all well, and thoroughly enjoying your IJCAI reviewing!

I'm working on Savile Row's Gecode (flatzinc) output -- I have a type in 
SR for negative table constraints (i.e. the tuple set represents the 
disallowed tuples). I don't see anything that looks relevant in 
registry.cpp.  Obviously turning it into a positive table constraint is 
an exponential explosion.

I could decompose into one constraint per tuple -- but of course this is 
horrible for propagation.

Can you suggest anything better?

Thanks,
Peter

Hi Pete,

Yes, I have a brilliant idea: how about you implement a negative table
constraint in Gecode! We would love it.

I think you get the gist: no, there is nothing really...

Cheers

Hi,

Thanks for the suggestions Christian and George (did you intend to post 
to the list George?). For now I have decided I need to make a release 
because the previous release has a fairly serious bug. I have done 
something quick and easy -- decompose into one constraint to rule out 
each tuple.  I should come back to this at some point.

I'm tempted to have a go at porting the MDDC and negative MDDC 
propagators that I wrote for Minion. However Gecode and Minion are 
different enough that I doubt it would be easy.

Pete
