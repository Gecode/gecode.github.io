Subject: [gecode-users] About the search engine BAB?
Message-ID: <54A59169.1070102@gmail.com>

Hi everyone,

I'm using the search engine BAB allowing to post dynamically new 
constraints throw the function "constrain()". Each time a better 
solution is found, I want to consider all the set of constraints added 
previously by "constrain()". How can I do this?

Thank you.
Amina.

Hi,

What do you mean by "consider"? Maybe a restart engine (check MPG) could be
a better fit.

Cheers

Hi,

I will ask the problem differently. We suppose that after generating the 
first solution S1, a constraint C1 is added throw the function 
constrain(). Then, after generating an other solution S2, a constrain C2 
is added, an so on.  When a solution Sn is found, dos gecode use all 
constraints previously added (C1,C2,...,Cn) to find an other solution? 
If No, how can i do this?

Thank you.
Cheers.

Hi,

BAB works under the assumption that the order imposed by the constrain()
function is strictly monotonic: that means, posting the constraint Cn
automatically subsume all constraints from C1 to Cn-1.

However, you can try to use the restart engine (RBS): here you can redefine
a so-called master() function so that the master will accumulate all the
constraints you want.

Hi Zoe,

 

I just fixed the bug in the trunk: now no-goods are extracted properly even for solutions. The problem was that the last leaf was missing in a no-good for a solution and in order to get that one, the search engines needed to be changed so that when they are stopped in for a restart, the path used for no-good extraction will really point to the next node in the tree... 

 

Expect a release pretty soon

 

Best

Christian

MPG does not make a promise here: it says "the solution might not be found again" but it does not give you a guarantee. But for your example I would have to know how nqueen_rbs looks like.

Subject: [gecode-users] A problem for restart

 

Dear all,

 

I met a problem when using ?restart in Gecode. 

 

I simply use restart to find all solutions for 4-Queens while use the same heuristic after each restart:  

./nqueen_rbs -restart geometric -restart-scale 2 -restart-base 10 -nogoods 1 -nogoods-limit 128 4

 

But I got into an infinite loop which keeps printing the first solution.

 

According to the newest version of document "MPG" (page 160), the master() function posts no-goods when the a solution is found. This means the same solution will not be found again.  

 

I rewrite the master() function by changing the last line "return true" into "return false", now all solutions are generated without trapped into a loop.

 

I am wondering why the infinite loop happens and whether Gecode has truly recorded previous solutions as nogoods as the document says.

 

Thanks for help.

 

Zichen

Because now I use INT_VAR_AFC_SIZE_MAX() variable heuristic while I do not

Hi Zoe,

 

No, by default that is not possible. In order to do it, one would have to really modify the kernel of Gecode.

 

I think you need it badly, right? If yes, I could think about it.

Hi Zoe,

 

I have an idea for a fix (a hack let?s say) but I think it will not fix the problem you are trying to solve. Let me try to explain: when your own propagator p triggers failure then there are two effects. One is that the AFC is counted for p (this is the fix you ask for). But the other effect is that if p had not been there some other propagator q might have triggered failure and the AFC of q would have increased. But now q?s AFC will not be incremented.

 

So, are you really sure that what you ask for will fix the issue? Because I?d hate to suggest a fix that will not solve the real problem anyway.

 

Cheers

Christian

Dear Christian,

You are worried that even though we do not count the AFC of p, the
heuristic is not exactly the same with the one without posting p, right?
It's acceptable.
One reason is that my constraint does have the same pruning effect with
other constraints in most of the cases. Another reason is that we
do not require heuristics are exactly the same.

So, just do not count AFC of p into its subscribed variables' AFC is
enough.


Regards,
Zoe

Dear Zoe,

 

No, the problem is that the AFC of _ q _ is not counted properly when you use it together with p! Is that not a problem?

 

Cheers

Christian

Dear all,

 

Is it possible to not count a propagator's AFC into its subscribed variables' AFC? 

Because now I use INT_VAR_AFC_SIZE_MAX() variable heuristic while I do not

Dear Christian,

The case you are worried is that when p and q have the same pruning effect
and the existence of p would make q lost some chance to increase its AFC,
right?
This case would not happen a lot because my constraint has little chance to
have the same pruning effect with the other constraints.

Actually, I would post p1 and p2 to a CSP respectively which have the same
pruning power. But they subscribe different subsets of variables. I would
like to compare there pruning efficiency under the similar heuristics.

Hi Zoe,

 

Here is a patch that adds a disable_afc() function to a propagator: you need to call it when the propagator is created and then all increments and are ignored. It is not tested though but should work (famous last words?).

 

Good luck

Christian
