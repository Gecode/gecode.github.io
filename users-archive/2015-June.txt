Message-ID: <CA+Lq8cqQvOjJT43uALhnWRdn1aC-zOUDL5tA9Ts+eCs7zdSvsA@mail.gmail.com>

I work for a small EDA company that simulates Verilog designs. One feature
of Verilog is a rich capability for expressing constraints on sets of
variables. We can currently handle simple constraint sets but believe it
will be beyond our resources to develop in house, a sophisticated
constraint solver. Gecode caught my eye as a possibility. Our code base is
C/C++.  I was wondering if anyone here has successfully used Gecode to
solve Verilog constraints?

Hi Christian,

Thanks for the pointer. I assume as applied here, it is the index for
the variable(s) in x that has the minimum value.

I did not know (or at least remember) about argmin, and I don't know if
it is common knowledge, so perhaps a little more explanation in the MPG
might be helpful?

I assume there is no offset that can be specified for this constraint,
to offset the index, as is available for some of the other constraints?
That is, in order to get this constraint so that the index start from 1,
I need to add a dummy 0'th element to x?

I think argmin is min_index in GCAT? This is not mentioned in the MPG,
as is done for other constraints in the MPG, or am I missing some
differences between argmin and min_index? (GCAT's minimum is also not
mentioned for min)

Cheers,

Kish

Hi Christian,

Thanks again.

I have implemented the argmin/max constraints for gfd (the ECLiPSe 
Gecode interface), but I have several questions:

1) I am using Ints::Limits::max for the dummy 0th element of the 
IntVarArray. Is this the correct choice, or does using such a large 
number affect the comlexity of the computation?

2) The MPG says that if tiebreak is false, then the constraint is domain 
consistent. However, ICL_DOM is not mentioned in the reference 
documentation. Is this because the constraint is not domain consistent 
for tiebreak = true?

I have implemented the tiebreak = true and false as 2 constraints, and 
for the false case, the constraint can be posted as domain consistent. I 
hope this is correct?

Thanks and cheers,

Kish

Subject: [gecode-users] empty array with argmin (and min)
Message-ID: <558D9915.80406@cisco.com>

Hi,

argmin throws an exception when the array is empty, which surprised me. 
I expected the constraint to fail, because for an empty array, the index 
for the minimum does not exist, i.e. the index has an empty domain, 
which should mean failure.

It seems that min also throws an exception for an empty array. and 
although it looks less clear-cut in this case, it still seem more 
logical to me that min should also fail rather than throw an exception.
I guess you might not want to do this with min as it will mean that 
IntExpr might fail, but argmin cannot occur in IntExpr.

To me, it seems reasonable that the user may want to call these 
constraints with an empty array -- the array may be generated from data, 
and finding no variables seems a reasonable possibility.

Cheers,

Kish

Hi Kish,

I agree that this is a matter of taste but I actually prefer that I have the
option to catch possible modeling errors. And one idea is that min and
argmin should behave the same.

In the scenario you describe you could then use a wrapper (or just have
sanity check when you generate the model).

Subject: [gecode-users] finding number of propagators for s Space,
	relation to floundering
Message-ID: <5591CBE9.4020204@cisco.com>

Hi,

Is there a way to determine the number of propagators in a space? I 
noticed that we don't provide a way to do this in gfd (ECLiPSe's Gecode 
interface). This is mostly because gfd's API is based largely on 
ECLiPSe's native finite domain solver (ic), and ic does not need to 
provide this, as the number of propagators (delayed goals) can be found 
using existing ECLiPSe's built-ins.

If a gfd program finishes without some propagators remaining, I assume 
this is equivalent to an ic program floundering, which is indicated by 
the presence of any delayed goals. e.g. for the following ic program:

[eclipse 3]: [A,B] :: 1..10, ic:min([A,B], M).

A = A{1 .. 10}
B = B{1 .. 10}
M = M{1 .. 10}


Delayed goals:
         ic_constraints : min2([A{1 .. 10}, B{1 .. 10}], M{1 .. 10})
Yes (0.00s cpu)

The min constraint remain when the program finished.

So I am thinking of providing a function in gfd to obtain the number of 
propagators, to allow the user to determine if floundering has occurred. 
It is also a useful measure of how big the problem is (along with the 
number of variables, which is readily available).

However, trying the min constraint, it seems that the propagator can 
remain even after the constraint is satisfied, e.g. the following gfd 
program (i.e. Gecode is used):

?- A :: 1 .. 20, gfd : min([100, A], M), get_constraints_number(M, D).
A = A{[1 .. 20]}
M = M{[1 .. 20]}
D = 1

(this is in ECLiPSe syntax, but I hope it is simple enough to 
understand: get_constraints_number/2 obtain the degree for the IntVar 
represented by M)

This shows that the variable M (and I also checked A, not shown here) 
still have a propagator attached to it even though the min constraint is 
satiisfied -- I assume this is the propagator for min that is still 
attached to the variables?

For comparison, for the equiivalent ic program, no delay goals remain, 
and the degree for M (obtained using delay_goals_number for ic) is 0:

[eclipse 3]: A :: 1..10, ic: min([A,100], M), ic: 
delayed_goals_number(M, D).

A = A{1 .. 10}
M = A{1 .. 10}
D = 0
Yes (0.00s cpu)

Is an alternative method needed to determine if floundering has occurred 
for a gfd program?

Thanks and cheers,

Kish

Thinking about this, I think the propagator might be a constraint 
linking M and A, as Gecode cannot unify the variables as ic does....

However, I was actually looking at argmin when I noticed that there was 
a propagator attached when the constraint was satisfied, but I decided 
to look at min instead as ic does not have argmin.

I can't show the ECLiPSe execution with argmin, as that is on a VNC 
window that I can't use cut and paste on, but here is what I tried:

min_index([1,2,3,1,4], I), get_constraints_number(I, D).

I = I{[1,4]}
D = 1

so there is 1 propagator attached to I in this case, when min_index 
(argmin) is entailed.

Cheers,

Kish

There is no guarantee that propagators detect entailment perfectly! So, no
bug.

A space has a function propagators() that returns the number of propagators
in a space.

(argmin) is entailed.

Cheers,

Kish

Hi,

I just made all changes to the trunk (better documentation, pointers into
the GCCAT, offset variants).

Then 1) becomes obsolete. 2) yes, that's the case.

Yep, that is correct.

Cheers
Christian

Hi Christian,

Thanks again.

I have implemented the argmin/max constraints for gfd (the ECLiPSe Gecode
interface), but I have several questions:

1) I am using Ints::Limits::max for the dummy 0th element of the
IntVarArray. Is this the correct choice, or does using such a large number
affect the comlexity of the computation?

2) The MPG says that if tiebreak is false, then the constraint is domain
consistent. However, ICL_DOM is not mentioned in the reference
documentation. Is this because the constraint is not domain consistent for
tiebreak = true?

I have implemented the tiebreak = true and false as 2 constraints, and for
the false case, the constraint can be posted as domain consistent. I hope
this is correct?

Thanks and cheers,

Kish

Hi Christian,

Thanks for your reply.

I wasn't really thinking that there was a bug, but rather if still 
having propagators around after you program finishes is a good indicator 
that there might be problems. For example, there may be some good 
reasons why propagators may remain after they are entailed in Gecode, as 
with the argmin case. I did wonder if it was worthwhile to detect the 
situation I found and remove the propagator (assuming it is not wrong to 
do so, which your reply suggest it is not wrong).

Do propagators always disappear when their variables all have a 
singleton domain? I was trying constraints where variables still have 
more than one domain value after they are entailed because in gfd I 
can't get the degree of a variable that are not bound (i.e. have more 
than one value in its domain).

Cheers,

Kish

Hi Kish,

You are right. A propagator in Gecode is required to become entailed (or
failed) if all of its variables are assigned. 

Cheers

Subject: [gecode-users] counting/sequence constraints failing when
	IntVarArray too small
Message-ID: <5592DA77.10501@cisco.com>

Hi,

My earlier post about min and argmin throwing an exception prompted me 
to remember a discussion I had with Joachim Schimpf some time ago about 
the semantics of the sequence constraint:

sequence(home, x, s, q, l, u)

if I remember correctly, he thought the constraint should not fail if 
the number of variables in x is smaller than q, but larger than l, and 
the number of values in x is between l and u. He actually was using the 
constraint on some problem instances that had this property.

I did not initially remember that the discussion was about sequence, so 
I first looked at the count constraint, and found a similar behaviour 
with the IRT_LQ and IRT_LE in

count(home, x, y, IRT_LQ, z)

the constraint fails if the size of x is smaller than than z, even 
though the relationship is actually true - the number of times the 
variables in x is y is less than z.

I had expected the constraint to succeed in this case, and the atmost 
constraint in ic does succeed in such cases (ic restrict z to be an 
integer for atmost). I can see that the count fails here because z is 
constrained to 0..|x|, for all relationships.

Does it make sense for these constraints to succeed in such cases when 
the relationship (number of times the value(s) occur) is satisfied, even 
though the number of variables is smaller than the limit/sequence 
length? I am uncertain for the sequence case, but for count, succeeding 
makes more sense to me.

If not succeeding, should an exception be raised instead of failing? 
This will alert the user to the fact that there are too few variables 
for the constraint, rather than the number of values not satisfying the 
requirements.

Should the behaviour be documented in the MPL? I don't think it is 
mentioned there at the moment.

Cheers,

Kish

Hi,

There is a paper discussing this:
	http://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007%2F978-3-642-04244-7_30

I rather have an exception in most cases. But documenting this in MPG is
really too much effort, that is why it is only in the reference
documentation.

Cheers
Christian
