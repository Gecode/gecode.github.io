<PRE>Hi,

Is there a way to determine the number of propagators in a space? I 
noticed that we don't provide a way to do this in gfd (ECLiPSe's Gecode 
interface). This is mostly because gfd's API is based largely on 
ECLiPSe's native finite domain solver (ic), and ic does not need to 
provide this, as the number of propagators (delayed goals) can be found 
using existing ECLiPSe's built-ins.

If a gfd program finishes without some propagators remaining, I assume 
this is equivalent to an ic program floundering, which is indicated by 
the presence of any delayed goals. e.g. for the following ic program:

[eclipse 3]: [A,B] :: 1..10, ic:min([A,B], M).

A = A{1 .. 10}
B = B{1 .. 10}
M = M{1 .. 10}


Delayed goals:
         ic_constraints : min2([A{1 .. 10}, B{1 .. 10}], M{1 .. 10})
Yes (0.00s cpu)

The min constraint remain when the program finished.

So I am thinking of providing a function in gfd to obtain the number of 
propagators, to allow the user to determine if floundering has occurred. 
It is also a useful measure of how big the problem is (along with the 
number of variables, which is readily available).

However, trying the min constraint, it seems that the propagator can 
remain even after the constraint is satisfied, e.g. the following gfd 
program (i.e. Gecode is used):

?- A :: 1 .. 20, gfd : min([100, A], M), get_constraints_number(M, D).
A = A{[1 .. 20]}
M = M{[1 .. 20]}
D = 1

(this is in ECLiPSe syntax, but I hope it is simple enough to 
understand: get_constraints_number/2 obtain the degree for the IntVar 
represented by M)

This shows that the variable M (and I also checked A, not shown here) 
still have a propagator attached to it even though the min constraint is 
satiisfied -- I assume this is the propagator for min that is still 
attached to the variables?

For comparison, for the equiivalent ic program, no delay goals remain, 
and the degree for M (obtained using delay_goals_number for ic) is 0:

[eclipse 3]: A :: 1..10, ic: min([A,100], M), ic: 
delayed_goals_number(M, D).

A = A{1 .. 10}
M = A{1 .. 10}
D = 0
Yes (0.00s cpu)

Is an alternative method needed to determine if floundering has occurred 
for a gfd program?

Thanks and cheers,

Kish
