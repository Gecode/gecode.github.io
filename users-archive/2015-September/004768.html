<PRE>Hi,
I have been playing with gecode for a few days and having a lot of fun.
My overall goal is to solve a large problem that has close to 6 million 
values that must be distinct. So kind of like this:

IntVarArray b(*this, 5784689, 0, 5784688);
distinct(*this, b);

Notice that the b's are constrained to be essentially a permutation of 
0...5784688.

These b values are generated by sets of linear equations derived from a 
directed acyclic multi-graph.
I expect district is a killer. I don't have a hope of attacking this big 
problem I think. So I am playing with smaller problems. I see gecode 
searching spaces like this:
So 6 b's that are distinct values with a range of 0..5:

b{[2..5], [1..4], [1..4], [1..4], [0..3], [0..3]} this should really be 
b{[5], [1..4], [1..4], [1..4], [0..3], [0..3]}. Maybe I am not using the 
right way to express what I want and the range and distinct aren't 
cooperating enough?
b{[2..4], [1..4], [1..4], [1..4], [0..3], [0..3]} no 5 at all so this 
should fail.

More complex case:

b{5, [3..4], [3..4], [2..4], [0..3], [0..3]} should be b{5, [3..4], 
[3..4], [2], [0..1], [0..1]}.
Computationally I guess it might be very expensive to discover these 
things. Even if you do discover these things I guess it might be it 
doesn't help that much.
Thanks.
Neill.
