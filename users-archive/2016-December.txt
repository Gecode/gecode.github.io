Hello Gecode users, I wish you pass a happy holidays,


i've a problem that contains six constraint that should be satisfied for the good functioning of the system. I suppose that one or more variables change their value which cause the failueres of one or more constraint. So, i want to find a new assignement of varibles so that i can satisfie a maximum number of contraints. Can any one help me to do it on gecode. Thankyou.
