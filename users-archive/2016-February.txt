Hi,

 

I have a suspicion here. The easiest might be to send me your implementation of the constrain() member function so that I can have a look.

 

Best

Christian

Hi again,

 

I just wanted to say that the lexicographic search worked perfectly. Thanks!

Now, I am stuck at a segmentation fault that appears when I try to run it in parallel mode (say, using 8 threads). The error happens irregularly, but more often when I increase the thread count. I will see if I can make a small code that reproduces the error. Here is the Visual Studio trace, in case it is a known bug.

 

Unhandled exception at 0x0F5A81BA (GecodeInt-4-4-0-d-x86.dll) in cpsolver.exe: 0xC0000005: Access violation reading location 0x0194379C.

Yes it's godly :)!

Let me jump on the bandwagon of showing off - http://isse-augsburg.github.io/constraint-relationships/ does really benefit from that feature (well, accessed by MiniSearch, but still!)

Cheers, have a good weekend

Alex is spot on here: but let me expand a little.

You might have used the cost() member function for B&B. However the cost()
member function is just implemented in terms of the constrain() member
function. So what I would do is the following:
 - Have a integer variable array cost containing the two cost variables you
have in mind.
 - implement a constrain(const Space& _b) member function: _b refers to the
so-far best solution. Cast this to your script type, say b. Then this just
posts
        rel(*this, cost, IRT_LQ, b.cost);
   This enforces that this->cost is lexicographically smaller then the so
far best cost b.cost.

That's it. More on the  constrain() function you can find in Chapter 2 of
MPG.

Cheers
Christian

Hi Juan,

it seems to me that you're searching for lexicographic branch-and-bound.
There is a global constraint lex_lesseq that you might want to consider for
posting in the constrain method of a Space.

Dear Alex and Christian,

thanks a lot! A very elegant solution - it works well, but I am now
battling with two problems

1. I get a segmentation fault when I try to run it in parallel mode (say,
using 8 threads). The error happens irregularly, but more often when I
increase the thread count. Here is what my constrain function looks like
for a maximization problem

virtual void constrain(const Space& _b){

const cpSolver& mycpSolver = static_cast<const cpSolver&>(_b);
rel(*this, objectives, IRT_GR, mycpSolver.objectives);

}

Since this does not really look like the other examples in the Gecode
manual, I guess that it is not correct. But I was unable to come up with
any other solution that rel would accept (that is, for which there is a
matching version of rel).

2. Ideally, I would like to have more than two objectives and have the
search to first try to maximize the first objective, then the second, etc.
But I do not manage, not matter which variable selection rule I use.
Typically, I get a little advancement in the first objective (say, it goes
from 0 to 1, and perhaps to two), and then the search makes progress on the
third or fourth objective in order.

Thanks,

JC

Hi Juan Carlos,

 

I think the ?solution? suggested by me was a little bit too elegant, in fact it is buggy and that?s why you experience segfaults? Reminds of an Einstein quote: Everything should be made as simple as possible, but not simpler.

 

The problem is as follows: variables in Gecode belong to just one space and they are deleted when the space is deleted. However in the constrain() function a new propagator is created with both variables from the *this space as well as from the space for the so-far best solution b. Now what can happen is that b might already be deleted while *this is still alive: hence the access to variables which are already did and kaboom: segfault!

 

The problem is easy to fix, though: when the constrain() function is called you create new variables, one for each variable from b, but now in *this! The variables in b must be assigned, so creating new variables in *this must happen with the variables assigned to the value of the respective variable in b.

 

The code should look this, roughly:

               IntVarArgs bo(*this, mycpSolver.objectives.size(), Int::Limits::min, Int::Limits::max);

               for (int i=0; i< mycpSolver.objectives.size(), i++)

                 rel(*this, bo[i], IRT_EQ, mycpSolver.objectives[i].val());

               rel(*this, objectives, IRT_LE, bo);

 

Sorry for not thinking about this in the first place. I?ll add a tip and a warning in MPG.

 

Cheers

Christian

Subject: [gecode-users] counting-based search in Gecode

I would like to integrate counting-based branching heuristics in Gecode. Like AFC we need to collect information from each constraint in which a given variable appears. But our information is more involved than a simple updated failure count --- we have dedicated algorithms computing "solution densities" for variable-value pairs. We saw that we can define a Brancher to make an integrated choice of both variable and value. But to host our solution counting code we see two options:

1) In objects of a class Counter which, like Propagator, would inherit from Actor and subscribe to variables. They would mainly implement a getSolutionDensity(var,val) method and possibly react to domain events by updating data structures (via Advisors?).

2) By inheriting directly from Propagator, say in a class CountablePropagator, which may allow us to share data structures used by the propagator: for example for the regular constraint the layered graph is augmented with counters of incoming and outgoing paths at nodes.

What's your opinion?

Thanks,
Gilles

Subject: [gecode-users] Constraining domain of variable to the index set of
	Boolean array?
Message-ID: <CAFd=f3EezyV6snJPQDAK0Sk5ZVPxcm4yEeHuWFhMAQxvQX_=Bw@mail.gmail.com>

I am wondering if there is any native support for the following constraint

x \in  { i such that y[i]=TRUE }

in Gecode. In other words, I would like to ensure that x is an index of a
true variable in the vector y.

In the global constraint catalog, this looks like a domain_constraint, and
there is a reference to "in" in Gecode, but I cannot find a matching
definition of the "in" constraint.

Am I overlooking something?

Grateful for help,
JC

Hi,

you can use the element constraint:
http://www.gecode.org/doc-latest/reference/group__TaskModelIntElement.html#ga4d6854069f6e77baa1ac353f7cb46e47 <http://www.gecode.org/doc-latest/reference/group__TaskModelIntElement.html#ga4d6854069f6e77baa1ac353f7cb46e47>

So if you have BoolVarArray y and IntVar x, you can post

element(*this, y, x, true);

which simply states that y[x]=true.

Cheers,
Guido

Hi Gilles,

That sounds really interesting, very nice!

I would never go for 1): This would require you to change things inside the
Gecode kernel. This will most likely be a very frustrating experience. Even
I would not dare doing that unless I had half year and under the assumption
that I know Gecode as well as I do already.

2) sounds more promising but still very ambitious.

If I were you, I would have a look at how activity information is recorded
(the files are in gecode/kernel). The idea is as follows: a propagator is
created which does not really do any propagation but it just records
information about how variables change. To make it efficient this propagator
is given a very high cost so that it will run only after all "real"
propagators have reached their fixpoint. And as you suggest it uses advisors
to do that. My gut feeling is that you can start very quickly from what is
already there for activity recording.

It is not that obvious how to share datastructures then. It is possible in
principle, though. But I'd really leave that to later.

Cheers
Christian
