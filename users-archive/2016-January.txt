Hi,

While in principle doable (one could call it INT_VAR_PATH or something), I
am not really convinced that one should actually do it: stuff to be added
must be reasonably reusable and I am not really sure that this is the case
here.

There is a tradeoff here: Adding something to Gecode's integer module comes
at a price because the system gets bigger, requires more doc and so on. It
might be cheaper to not add it but leave it to the user. After all, you can
do it easily enough in Gecode yourself. That is the very reason why Gecode
has the extensive documentation of how to do stuff yourself.

But if there are more users who express interest I am willing to consider...
Anyone?

Cheers
Christian

Hi,

Thanks for the "Knights" example.
Could this be an improvement of Gecode than developing this brancher so that
we can call via the branch method? If so how can we call the variable
selection  strategy?

Subject: [gecode-users] Usage of layered graphs,

Hi Coby,

Uff, that's really a hard one and I do not really have an answer. The key
point is that the layered graph as constructed by initialize cannot be used
really standalone. The data structure essentially makes three key
assumptions:
 1. The variable domains are restricted as done in the ::post() member
function.
 2. When the data structure is copied you do it as done the ::LayeredGraph
constructor (the additional steps in the ::copy() meber function are really
only optimizations of the data structure but not crucial).
 3. Any changes to the data structure are done as implemented by ::advise()
and ::propagate() together. Only their combination make sure that the data
structure's invariants hold.

I do not know how much reading you already did in the Part P of MPG but you
will have to read and understand pretty much all of it.

The problem is really that the implementation is highly optimized and has
pretty tricky invariants to maintain. The level of documentation is barely
enough for me ;-)

Sorry that I do not have to offer something more helpful than this.

All the best
Christian

Subject: [gecode-users] Usage of layered graphs, without regard for
propagation, and audit failure

Dear Gecode Users:

I am working on a project for which (as an initial step) I need to convert
regular expressions to layered graphs, of the form provided by Gilles Pesant
in his 2004 LNCS paper.

For this purpose, I would like to use
Gecode::Int::Extensional::LayeredGraph, constructed from a Gecode
DFA-converted regex. I am able to construct a valid DFA, but am having some
difficulties constructing a layered graph corresponding to it. I can create
the object itself, using the LayeredGraph (Home home, const VarArgArray< Var
> &x, const DFA &dfa) constructor for posting. However, the resulting graph
appears to be invalid.

Upon posting it (via Gecode::Int::Extensional::LayeredGraph< View, Val,
Degree, StateIdx >::LayeredGraph), it appears that I also need to run
Gecode::Int::Extensional::LayeredGraph< View, Val, Degree, StateIdx
>::initialize, with the same arguments to get a valid initialization of the
layered graph (otherwise the pointer assigned to layers is invalid, as are
further indices of that array). Once I call initialize, I can access all
layers, and there are indeed as many as stated by n (the number of layers).
However, the  data structures of the layered graph are not consistent. In
particular, audit fails on its first assertion (concerning the number of
edges). Manual inspection in gdb shows that the numbers reported for total
states and edges are way off, both having values of zero, while the actual
numbers vastly exceed that (e.g. layer 0 of 11, on support index 2, appears
to have 16254 edges and 8880 states). Valgrind shows an error when a call to
audit is included, saying that a "Conditional jump or move depends on
uninitialised value(s)", but providing no further information other than
showing the error originated from the audit call and that the "Uninitialised
value was created b  y a stack allocation" from the main method itself.
Valgrind shows similar errors if n_states or n_edges are printed from the
layered graph. While both erroneously (I assume) output 0, Valgrind detects
memory errors, one similar to the previous one and another referring to the
"Use of uninitialised value of size 8" at the line of code that outputs
either n_states or n_edges.

The documentation on this topic is sparse, and understandably so, since I am
essentially abusing an internal Gecode class for something that it was not
designed for. I was hoping for some guidance on how best to construct the
layered graph corresponding to a DFA, ignoring notions of propagation or
constraint-satisfaction, since I am only interested in using the layered
graph itself.

What would be a reasonable instantiation of the templates: <View, Val,
Degree, StateId> for this purpose? Currently I am using: <Int::IntView, int,
int, int>. Is this a sensible instantiation?

For my purpose, I am attempting to use IntVarArgs that consist of constant
integers (i.e. argument is an IntVar, but with min = max). 
These integers correspond to those used in my DFA. Is there any issue with
having such a sequence and is that a valid usage of IntVarArgs?

What would be a good way to simply output the structure of the entire
layered graph in some structured format or for me to access its components?
It appears that I can access the layers easily enough, but the edges
themselves are only temporarily recorded or bound to their support; is that
correct? What would be an idiomatic way of iterating over the representation
of transition variables / state variables?

I apologize if my questions lack precision and would be happy to provide any
necessary clarifications; this is far from my area of expertise.

I would appreciate any pointers or advice that anyone can provide.

Thank you in advance,

Coby Viner

P.S.  Congratulations on Gecode's recent 10th birthday!

Hi everybody,

I am implementing a propagator over an array of SetView: x[0], x[1], 
....x[n]. The propagate function is executed only if a variable is 
assigned. For example, if the domain of x[0] is [{} .. {1,2,3,4}], when 
x[0] is assigned to {1}, the value "2" and "4" must be deleted from the 
domain of x[0] to avoid the enumeration of x[0]={1,2} and x[0]={1,4}, 
How can I apply this filtering rule?

Thanks for your help.

	in Gecode?
Message-ID: <CAFd=f3EAU+XPqJo02KPT9SWibPjxkifw-F2so-4mE+x4Kv7Q5A@mail.gmail.com>

Hi everyone,


I am trying to use Gecode to solve a multi-criterion problem


minimize        (F1(x,z), F2(x,z) )

subject to       constraints on x,z


The objectives are ordered in order of importance, so I would like to first
solve the problem P1


minimize        F1(x,z)

subject to       original constraints on x,z


and then consider the modified problem P2


minimize        F2(x,z)

subject to      original constraints on x,z

                        F1(x,z) = F1opt


where F1opt is the optimal value of P1.


What is the most efficient way to implement this in Gecode?



I am now doing two completely separate searches, in the sense that I create
a new Space and run BAB on it for each of the problems. I am sure that this
cannot be the most efficient way of dealing with the problem, but am unable
to figure out how to do it "the right way". Essentially, when solving P2 I
should be able to make use of the work done while solving P1...


Any feedback is very much appreciated!


Thanks,

JC

Hi Juan,

it seems to me that you're searching for lexicographic branch-and-bound.
There is a global constraint lex_lesseq that you might want to consider 
for posting in the constrain method of a Space.

Alex

Alex is spot on here: but let me expand a little.

You might have used the cost() member function for B&B. However the cost()
member function is just implemented in terms of the constrain() member
function. So what I would do is the following:
 - Have a integer variable array cost containing the two cost variables you
have in mind.
 - implement a constrain(const Space& _b) member function: _b refers to the
so-far best solution. Cast this to your script type, say b. Then this just
posts
	rel(*this, cost, IRT_LQ, b.cost);
   This enforces that this->cost is lexicographically smaller then the so
far best cost b.cost.

That's it. More on the  constrain() function you can find in Chapter 2 of
MPG.

Cheers
Christian
