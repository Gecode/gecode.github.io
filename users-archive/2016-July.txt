Subject: [gecode-users] fzn-gecode -mode gist and variable names
Message-ID: <CAPYSQkQU+yUS5-_v6TMzTXNokqBVKzN16YZ-3Gi5Cr8Uw6yVig@mail.gmail.com>

Hi, I have a problem with fzn-gecode -mode gist, Gecode trunk 14847,
MiniZinc 2.0.13.
Namely, anonymous variable names like var[123] get displayed instead of the
variable names of the .fzn file.  Admittedly, the latter names are a bit
awkward, but at least they enable me to relate back to the names of the
MiniZinc model.  But I have no idea how to map the var[...] names to the
names of the .fzn file. I have tried to edit the .fzn file in various ways
to make Gist use its names, but it has not helped.  Is there some
work-around?

See the attachment for an example.

Subject: [gecode-users] scheduling problem, tow branchers, order of branching
Message-ID: <CAKWAxkZ0YCYWWU+b_VpbQJ4g6_3=M8MQrhxQnQN7nMDv7VrqCA@mail.gmail.com>

Hi to everyone on the ML,

I am working on a scheduling problem,I have two variable array:

*IntVarArray QuantityTask*;

*SetVarArray WorkTimeTask*;


ant two branchers:

branch(*this,QuantityTask,INT_VAR_NONE(),INT_VAL_MIN());

assign(*this,WorkTimeTask,SET_ASSIGN_MIN_INC());


Asume I have 2 tasks, Gecode's default enumration order is:

(branch)QuantityTask[0]-->(branch)QuantityTask[1]-->(assign)WorkTimeTak[0]-->(assign)WorkTimeTask[1],

*how can I achieve this:*

*(branch)QuantityTask[0]-->(assign)WorkTimeTak[0]-->(branch)QuantityTask[1]-->(assign)WorkTimeTask[1]*


I have read MPG 8.14 Executing code between branchers,
and http://www.gecode.org/pipermail/users/2015-April/004669.html,
but has not a clue.

Thank you!

Best,
Wu Shaowei
