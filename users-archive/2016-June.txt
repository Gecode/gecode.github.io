Subject: [gecode-users] Update variable domain during search
Message-ID: <AM5PR10MB06112604F542E28E8F350245B7290@AM5PR10MB0611.EURPRD10.PROD.OUTLOOK.COM>

Hi Everyone,


I'm wondering how can i during a search update a variable domain (for example increase the upper bound) in order to force the next solutions to be better than last found one.


I know there is in gecode, the "constrain" function to dynamically post new constraint on seached solutions, but i'm trying to do it without using posting new constraints, just with support raising.


Thanks for helps.


Cheers.

Hi,

 

Just don't. From your description I have really no idea what you try to do.
Do you?
