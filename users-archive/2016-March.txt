Hi everyone,
i'am wondering, about the propagation algorithm that Gecode is using, i think is AC3. but i'm not sure and didn't find clarification on mpg.
Can you confirm for AC3 ? or another algorithm.

No, it has nothing to do with AC3. Check the following papers:

 
http://www.gecode.org/~schulte/paper.html?id=SchulteStuckey:TOPLAS:2008

and

 
http://www.gecode.org/~schulte/paper.html?id=LagerkvistSchulte:CP:2007

They describe the algorithm used.

	propagator
Message-ID: <CAGSNhTjN65wQUObqvgCo=gVrsauQTSSwvOxgP9Gd0hQ_wQOVWg@mail.gmail.com>

Hi everyone,

I have a tunneling constraint propagator that has 4 ViewArrays and
scheduled to run on their assignment events:

    Gecode::ViewArray<Gecode::Int::IntView> successors_;
  Gecode::ViewArray<Gecode::Int::IntView> predecessors_;
  Gecode::ViewArray<Gecode::Int::IntView> vehicles_;
  Gecode::ViewArray<Gecode::Int::BoolView> cancels_;

  successors_.subscribe(home, *this, Gecode::Int::PC_INT_VAL);
  predecessors_.subscribe(home, *this, Gecode::Int::PC_INT_VAL);
  vehicles_.subscribe(home, *this, Gecode::Int::PC_INT_VAL);

I want to post additional constraints whenever a value gets fixed over
those arrays.

for (int i = 0; i < successors_.size(); ++i) {
    if (vehicles_[i].assigned()) {
        int val = vehicles_[i].val();
        // post constraint...
        // eg.
        Gecode::element(home, vehicles_, successors_[i], val);
    }
    if (successors_[i].assigned()) {
        int val = successors_[i].val();
        // post another constraint ...
    }
}

For example assume that we first assign the vehicle[2] to some value and
propagate accordingly.
Then if we assign vehicle[7] how can we prevent doing same action for
vehicle[2].

Does it post the same constraints for all the previously assigned
variables, again and again.... ?

Is there a way to get the recently assigned variable that cause th?s
propagator to run?

Cheers,
Yunus

Hi Yunus,

 

There are two options here:

1.       You track inside your propagator for which assigned variable you have already created a propagator. One easy trick is (it depends on your propagator whether this is in fact possible) to remove assigned views from your array. Another option would be to use a bitset or something like that.

2.       You can track which views get assigned by using advisors. Please check MPG for the details.

 

Best

Christian

Hi Christian,

Thanks for the quick reply.

Bitset suggestion in the first option seems easier to implement.
But considering that each ViewArray holds around 15000+ Views, would it be
better to use Advisors performance wise?

Best regards
Yunus

Hi, I would go for the advisors. It is reasonably straightforward and the most efficient.

Message-ID: <loom.20160331T061039-928@post.gmane.org>

Hello,

I have a design problem when using a b&b engine. Here it is :
When a solution S is found I have to confirm it using an external
 algorithm. It's only if S is confirmed that the next solution S ' 
must have a better cost than S.
For now, i use a DFS engine and i reject or accept S' myself. 
Is there a better solution (using constraint(S) for instance ?).

Thanks,

Hi,

Would use a BAB engine and add the external check by synchronized execution
(when some variables have been assigned), please check Section 4.5 for the
details.
