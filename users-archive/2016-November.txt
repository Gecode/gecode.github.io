Subject: [gecode-users] Compile gecode for 32-bit under Linux
Message-ID: <f0868401-d973-cfad-8fa4-8b033d237e40@optor.ch>

Hi,

I'd like to compare the performance of a 64-bit version of fzn-gecode to
a 32-bit-version unter Linux (Ubuntu 16.04 or 14.04) for a certain
problem. But I could not crosscompile it.

I know that it's possible, because in the Minizinc IDE is a fzn-gecode
for 32 bit. But this version has dependencies to Qt (which I don't have
running it on a server). That's how I compile what I need on 64 bit:

static:

export PREFIX="/home/nath/apps/gecode-5.0.0"
./configure \
  --prefix="$PREFIX" --enable-float-vars=no --enable-examples=no --enable-qt=no --enable-gist=no --enable-doc-dot=no \
  --enable-doc-tagfile=no --enable-driver=no --enable-examples=no --enable-scheduling=no --enable-graph=no --enable-minimodel=no \
  --enable-static --disable-shared

shared:

export PREFIX="/home/nath/apps/gecode-5.0.0"
CFLAGS="-Wl,-rpath,$PREFIX/lib" CXXFLAGS="-Wl,-rpath,$PREFIX/lib" \
   ./configure \
  --prefix="$PREFIX" --enable-float-vars=no --enable-examples=no --enable-qt=no --enable-gist=no --enable-doc-dot=no \
  --enable-doc-tagfile=no --enable-driver=no --enable-examples=no --enable-scheduling=no --enable-graph=no --enable-minimodel=no

Now what to cange / add to get a 32-bit binary in the end?

I tried a lot of things with Flags and setting env-Variables before
compiling found as general tips for cross compiling, but nothing worked
for fzn-gecode. What do I need to do?

Thank you

Alexander

Hi,

Even though this is not really a Gecode-related question, the catch is that
you need to pick up the right compiler, either 64 or 32 bit. You have to
figure this out for your platform.

Let's assume the C++ compiler for 32 bit is called g++-32 (that's most
likely wrong) and the C compiler is called gcc-32 (again, made up) then you
can set the environment variable CXX and CC before you run configure to
point to the right C++ and C compilers (one can also pass that to make by
make CXX=g++-32 CC=gcc-32).

Hope that helps
Christian

Subject: [gecode-users] Questions about element and channel constraint for
	float variables
Message-ID: <CAMU5eQwwj9FuE97bgxbgvDU2hrUuDNFJuKQjQiWocV++hXARXg@mail.gmail.com>

Hello all,

These ares my first question, thanks for this library, I found it very
interesting and the tutorial is really great.

I'm using the last version of Gecode 5.0. In the project I'm working on I
need to use float variables (the problem include exponential calculations
that need to be precise), although I'm trying to minimize their use as much
as possible by converting Floats into Into Ints. Two questions arises:

- I couldn't find a "element" constraint for FloatVarArray, and it would
really help me. I don't know if I could easily reimplemented it using the
example of the constraint for Int variables, or there will be some problem?
Should I find a different modelling, like using a linear constraint using a
0,1 vector?

- To minimize the use of Float variables I want to round my Float
calculations using two digits and then convert them to Int using a channel
constraint. I imagine that I need to take into account the rouding if i
want to make it work. This sounds right?

IntVar time; // Variable used in other constraints
FloatVar time_float(home, TIME_MIN, TIME_MAX); // conversion to float

channel(home, time, time_float); // conversion to float for the calculations

// float calculation, this will obviously wil be any float number
FloatVar activity_float= expr(home, c1 * exp( c2 * time_float);

// Rounded version of activity multiplied by 100 to be converted into Int
FloatVar activity_float_rounded100(home, ACTIVITY_MIN, ACTIVITY_MAX);

// Rounding up, and multiplying by 100 to keep the desired precision
rel(home, activity_float_rounded100   >= 100* activity_float);
rel(home, activity_float_rounded100-1 <  100* activity_float);

IntVar activity_int(home, ACTIVITY_MIN, ACTIVITY_MAX); // rounded activity
by 100
channel(home,activity_int, activity_float_rounded100);

// now activity_int can be used in other int constraints

I bellieve that if I apply directly the channel to activity_float, the
exponential constraint will fail as channel will force activity to be
exactly equal to the Int value, am I right?


Thank you very much your work and for your thoughts

Best regards

Daniel

Hi,

you could decompose the element constraint by posting implications instead, such as x=i implies y=a[i] for all i.

Regarding the rounding, you're right, your approach should work (and just using a channel directly forces the float var to take an integral value).

Cheers,
Guido

Hi,

the 4GB memory limit still applies (there's no way around it, you simply can't address more with 32 bit pointers!).

Cheers,

Hello every one,

Latley, i asked the gecode users about solving a max-sat instance on gecode, but they adviced me that it will be not effective compare to dictated solver. However, could i use the didtacted solver like SAT4J or minsat on Gecode, to take profit of its rich c++ library and others constraints
