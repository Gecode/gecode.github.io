Message-ID: <CAFtkpkjYBCQSPJ_qUNyAJJwQOYT-qfZU=Y0Q6KgJj104U8tLrQ@mail.gmail.com>

Hello -


I am trying to do program up a search engine that performs sequential
refinement by adding more and more constraints to a model. In the first
run, I am happy with a solution at all, but then I want to add increasingly
complex constraints until there is no more solution (or the search engine
times out).


Now, I first run a model with a single constraint. If DFS can find a
solution, then I run a completely new model with two constraints and from
scratch. If this model is feasible, then I run the model with three
constraints, etc.


In principle, this solution works, but it is a very inefficient: a lot of
time is spent generating the first feasible solution when restarting the
search (especially as the problem becomes more constrained).


It seems to me that this should be doable with RBS or a variation of the
LDS engine, as described in the MPG. But there are very few examples to
follow (the closest I found was this question posted on stack overflow
http://stackoverflow.com/questions/34182681/how-to-change-the-variable-value-ordering-in-gecodes-restart-based-search
but unfortunately it does not contain any answer). I simply cannot
understand how to do it right. In particular, where do I post additional
constraint on the model (in the master space, the slave space or
elsewhere)?


Any leads on how to do it, or links to code that adds constraints or
changes branching order in RBS would be appreciated!


Cheers,


Dirk

Hi,

 

First, I am not so sure that your idea works in principle: you say that the problem is that you spend a lot of time to find a first feasible solution, especially after adding additional constraints. However, that would not change with restarts: after all, you would restart the search and would have to do the same search in order to find the first feasible solution. The only benefit I could see is adding no-goods from restarts.

 

Anyway, what you want to do (I guess) is that you accumulate additional constraints which each restart. This you can only do by adding constraints to the master (remember, the slave will always be initialized fresh from the master for each restart). LNS is different as you want try different constraints each time you restart, hence you have to do it on the slave.

 

Hence, you will have to reimplement the master function, there you just add the additional constraints.

 

Have you thought about using BAB? There, each time you find a solution you can add new constraints based on that solution _without_ restarting search. Sounds more like it to me.

 

Cheers

Christian

Thanks, Christian.

You were, of course, correct. BAB does the job and my code is now much more
elegant than before. It also works well to combine with RBS.

However, my earlier code was sometimes faster. The reason is that I could
take "large steps", adding constraints in chunks until the search failed. I
 could then go back to the last feasible model and add constraints one by
one instead of in chunks.

Is something similar possible in the gecode search engines? What I would
like do is  the following: I run BAB until fail, and then "reset the state
of the engine" to where it was when it produced the last feasible solution
("before my last call to the constrain function", so to speak). I would
then re-run the search from there (with another behavior of the constrain
function).

Thanks,
Dirk

Is there are any solution for such a constraint:  for 2 integer Arrays of
the same size

x_i = x_j => y_i = y_j

in other words, there is an integer function such

x = f(y)

Hi,

 

Unfortunately not, you will have to resort to reification to model that.

 

Best

Hi Dirk,

 

Yes, I see your motivation but the Gecode engines cannot do that. Have you ever had a look at the part in MPG about search? Building a BAB engine with this additional feature might be not that hard?

 

Good luck

Christian
