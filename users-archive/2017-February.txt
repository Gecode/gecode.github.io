Subject: [gecode-users] Float values and element constraint
Message-ID: <CADi7bxqotN0tjPGDczZ=H_XNntEBbWMfN-uD6D8y0sTVQi3Eyg@mail.gmail.com>

Hello All,

I am a Gecode novice and seeking your expert help on one of the issue that
I am facing when using float values.

In the example warehouse.cpp, the supply cost from a warehouse to a store
is defined using an int value matrix (c_supply). This matrix is later used
in one of the constraint that computes the cost. Now I want to use a cost
matrix of float values. However, the constraint uses an 'element'
constraint to compute the cost which is not defined for float values. How
can I convert the constraint to use float values? Any help is greatly
appreciated.

For your reference, the relevant code from the example is follows:

// Compute cost for each warehouse
for (int s=0; s<n_stores; s++) {
   IntArgs c(n_warehouses, c_supply[s]);
   c_store[s] = expr(*this, element(c, supplier[s]));
}

(What I want is to have a FloatValArgs type for c.)

Thanks and Regards
Arshad

Hello Arshad,

You should check the mail archives. I just posted a similar question few
months ago and here is the answer:

http://www.gecode.org/pipermail/users/2016-November/004911.html

In any case, I would really try to convert your float variables into a
Integer one. For example, in a similar problem I used cents (integer)
instead of dollars (float), just by multiplying by 100 my input values...
In any case, I find float variables more complicated to use.

Regards

Daniel

Hi Daniel

Thanks for your reply and link to the post. I tried searching the archive
but seems like gmane is having some issues at the moment.

Conversion of floats to int is a good proposition. I was also thinking on
the same lines but wanted to find if a direct approach using floats could
be used. Also, the suggestion from Guido on use of implication to break the
element constraint looks interesting too.

Regards
Arshad
