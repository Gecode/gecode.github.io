Hello Gecode users, I wish you pass a happy holidays,


I've a problematic that i do not know if it is possible to code it on gecode. The problem contains six constraint that should be satisfied for the good functioning of the system. I suppose that one or more variables change their value which cause the failueres of one or more constraint. So, i want to find a new assignement of varibles so that i can satisfie a maximum number of contraints. Can any one help me to do it on gecode. Thankyou.

Hello Assia,

Your mail is not very clear but I'll try to give it a try.

I think that the general problem that you are describing can be model with
Gecode, but there are many aspects to take into account. For example, if
your variables are not integers, constraint programming  might not be the
best optimization method to try (check information on constraint
programming to understand why).

Once you have a general idea on constraint programming, read the nice
documentation on Gecode. You should be able to create the program related
to your problem pretty fast.

Regards

Daniel

Hi,
I was wondering if people thought if constraint satisfaction in general 
and more specifically gecode was suitable for solving quickly a system 
system like this:

$a_1x_1+a_2x_2+...+a_rx_r=n$
$1 \leq a_i$
$1 \leq x_i \leq 2^l$
$1 \leq l$
All variables are integers. a_i is given. We want to find the x_i's.

I have billions of these problems that I could attempt to solve in an 
algorithm I have for computing optimal addition chains. Currently I am 
only solving cases with $r=2$ using extended gcd. This gives me a very 
powerful prune in the code.

Do you think gecode solves these type of problems efficiently? I know I 
can do the equivalent of extended gcd in higher dimensions with the 
Blankinship algorithm etc and then try to enumerate solutions via the 
specific solution and the null space but I haven't managed to achieve 
anything with this approach yet.
What techniques does gecode use to solve such systems (assuming you have 
something special for linear constraints)?
I have written code using gecode before so I am familiar with it's 
usage. I am just trying to understand if it might be a good approach or 
if there are good approaches from constraint satisfaction.
Thanks.
Neill.

Hi Neill,

Gecode uses standard propagation techniques for linear equations: depending
on the size and values of the a_i propagation tends to be rather weak. It
can use domain consistent propagation for the linear constraint but its
complexity is exponential.

It might work reasonably well for small r but why not using a linear integer
programming solver:

Hi,
Thanks for your response. I was hoping there was some technique I wasn't 
aware of used in constraint satisfaction systems.
r is small in my system. In fact just having something for r=3 would be 
a big deal. It has to be very fast though as this would be a prune.
I am familiar with integer programming but I thought using something 
like glpk would be too slow.

Hi,

I would just try it out, should be just ten or so lines of code... For r=3
things might go well...

The basic pruning used for linear is that the min and max of each variable
is adjusted to feasible values (feasible as reals and then rounded to
integers).

Cheers
Christian

	Resources
Message-ID: <199C60CE4755B540A8D7A85660D006082ADD5A54@COLUMBA02.user.uu.se>

Hello, 

I've implemented a custom propagator and brancher which are sharing a data-structure (a matrix of values), To share the structure in an efficient (and convenient) way I have looked at using LocalHandle and LocalObject. In MPG (Sec 31.4, page 391) this is described how to be implemented, however I am doing something wrong because I keep on getting some kind of memory error.

My main problem is with the notice for disposal (since external resources are used). If I do not use home.notice(*this, AP_DISPOSE) (line 17 in attached file), my program does run without errors, but I suspect it might lead to memory leaks. I've tried figuring out how this should work, but I have yet to find a full example using LocalHandle/LocalObject (i.e. together with a model) and no previous issues around this.

I'm attaching a minimum failing example (main.cpp), I'm compiling it on ubuntu using g++ version 5.4.0. and Gecode version 5.0.0 (I'm fairly sure, do not know how to exactly check this) using the following command:
	g++ -g -o main src/main.cpp -lgecodedriver -lgecodegist -lgecodesearch -lgecodeminimodel -lgecodeint -lgecodekernel -lgecodesupport
and when running it I receive the following error (gdb output):
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
Program received signal SIGSEGV, Segmentation fault.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

Any ideas on what might be the problem is greatly appreciated. My guess is that perhaps the destructor of the LocalHandle (LH) class have to make sure dispose is called on the LocalObject (LHO), however my skills in C++  and Gecode are not enough to know how I can try this. If someone just have an implementation using LocalHandles/LocalObjects which is working, just letting me have a look on that would be very helpful!

Best regards,
Peter Backeman

Hi,

I would like to know if it is possible to Re-execut a program with modified variables if it couldn't find any solution in first time.
The solution is to recover the number of solutions found by the program. Is it possible?

Hi,

This is hard to debug remotely but here is the catch:
 - you have a shared datastructure that you have put into a local object.
 - you need to make sure that both propagator and brancher destruct the
local handle but only if neither needs it any longer. If you make use of the
local handle in both propagator as well as brancher then everything should
be fine.
 - for the propagator it means you have to use the AP_DISPOSE thing as you
did. In its dispose method you have to add an explicit call to the
destructor of the local handle, say that the local object is names lo and of
type Foo. Then lo.~Foo() will do the trick.
 - for the brancher you also have to call in its dispose method the
destructor.

My guess is that the error comes from the fact that the shared object has
already been destroyed by either propagator or brancher and the other still
tries to access it.

Cheers
Christian

MPG (Sec 31.4, page 391) this is described how to be implemented, however I
am doing something wrong because I keep on getting some kind of memory
error.

My main problem is with the notice for disposal (since external resources
are used). If I do not use home.notice(*this, AP_DISPOSE) (line 17 in
attached file), my program does run without errors, but I suspect it might
lead to memory leaks. I've tried figuring out how this should work, but I
have yet to find a full example using LocalHandle/LocalObject (i.e. together
with a model) and no previous issues around this.

I'm attaching a minimum failing example (main.cpp), I'm compiling it on
ubuntu using g++ version 5.4.0. and Gecode version 5.0.0 (I'm fairly sure,
do not know how to exactly check this) using the following command:
	g++ -g -o main src/main.cpp -lgecodedriver -lgecodegist
-lgecodesearch -lgecodeminimodel -lgecodeint -lgecodekernel -lgecodesupport
and when running it I receive the following error (gdb output):
----------------------------------------------------------------------------

Any ideas on what might be the problem is greatly appreciated. My guess is
that perhaps the destructor of the LocalHandle (LH) class have to make sure
dispose is called on the LocalObject (LHO), however my skills in C++  and
Gecode are not enough to know how I can try this. If someone just have an
implementation using LocalHandles/LocalObjects which is working, just
letting me have a look on that would be very helpful!

Hi,

I would like to know if it is possible to Re-execut a program with modified variables if it couldn't find any solution in first time. 
The solution is to recover the number of solutions found by the program. Is it possible?

When I do   mzn2fzn golomb.mzn 03.dzn  (from minizinc-benchmarks)

Why not just download the minizinc distribution? It includes Gecode. Cheers

You may have run into a problem with the latest version of the GCC compiler. ?You can try compiling the current svn trunk, it should fix this issue.

Thanks, that fixed it!

I have gcc (GCC) 6.3.1 20161221 (Red Hat 6.3.1-1)
and gecode trunk (rev 15370) seems to work fine now.

Dear all,

the changelog for 5.0.0 says
"added extensive tracing functionality".

is there a way to get traces without touching source code:

some command line option for the flatzinc back-end?
for running the gecode examples?

I want my students to get a feeling for how the search proceeds,
but I do not want to require of them (in my current course)
to write/change models in C++. (Not because I don't think
they could do it, but because there is little time.)

- Johannes.

Hi,

Using tracing without adding something to the code is not possible. However,
tracing does not trace search it traces propagation and is really not meant
for instructional purposes.

Have you tried Gist instead: that helps a lot to understand search.  Just
invoked fz.exe with -help. It will tell you that you can use -mode gist as a
commandline option.

Cheers
Christian

sorry for not being clear enough,
"propagation" *is* a topic of my course.
(using parts of Chapter 7 of: Apt: Principles of C.P.)

> Have you tried Gist instead: 

Thanks, I will. - What does it do, exactly:

it does run a full search (until next or all solutions),
then draws the tree?

I see that I can inspect a node, to see a domain assignment.

Is it also possible to "inspect an edge", that is,
to see why the domain assignment changed
when going from a node to its child?

Right. ("Node -> Label branches" could be on by default?)
I will use Gist some more in the next iteration of my course.

(10.1) "Each node in the tree represents a fixpoint of propagation".
I wish there was a way to visualize individual propagation steps.

Since this thread is originally about tracing: I found that
MPG mentions that some examples are compiled with tracing enabled.
Grepping the source suggests that these are  descartes-folium,
hamming, and money. Indeed `money -trace all` looks nice,
and it does show individual propagations.

Hi,

I work on preparing binary packages for gecode 5. Wanted to use ?cpack? that is extension to ?cmake?. Unfortunately I have some problems while linking gecodefloat with mpfr. Could anybody with more experience in cmake shed some light on what am I doing wrong? ;)

Seconded. But - (Downloading and) opening a 500 page PDF
is rather heavy. Is there a HTML version, on the web somewhere,
with URLs for sections, so that it's easy to refer to?

I know there is "online HTML" doc at
http://www.gecode.org/documentation.html
but this refers to the C++ API only (?)
E.g., when I search for "command line"
(expecting to find something towards the answer you gave,
"commandline ?solutions 0 ?mode stat"),
this is not really helpful:

What? That is a real luxury complaint...

You know how much work it is to write a coherent 500 page document? That's
not that easy to do as html.

And searching in PDF is not that hard...

Hm ? that being said, chiming in as a casual user ? I've wondered before 
whether a tex(t) source of the PDF is available.

No question: MPG is one of the best piece of documentation I've ever had 
the pleasure of reading. The breadth and depth and coherence really are 
an impressive accomplishment.

The underlying expectation, though, is that users read it like a 
textbook ? when realistically people just want to google their problem, 
click, immediately be in the right section, aha, click, there's the link 
to the function reference, click, open a new tab, etc. When you work 
with a system as large as Gecode for a few days, constantly going back 
and forth between scrolling through a massive PDF and looking for 
corresponding doxygen pages becomes a bit tedious.

Yes, a total luxury complaint. I also get that you're worried about a 
bunch of different versions of the docs floating around. Just maybe if 
you publish the source people can experiment with pandoc-ing it straight 
into a doxygen or Sphinx format, and perhaps it'll become apparent that 
they really find that easier to use?

Hmmm, I can understand your reasoning but I'd rather not make the sources
public...

I know that's a massive piece but typically only few chapters are needed.
For me it works okay (yes, I have to look things up often myself) with
searching in the PDF and a viewer that shows also the document structure
(quite important!).

Cheers
Christian

Subject: [gecode-users] Pair counting constraint
Message-ID: <CABnemvyCnESmQaKsMV_oKRp_rFT+sv4k+o41gUXe1CFv-nyqBw@mail.gmail.com>

I have two IntVarArgs variables both of length of n, with domain from 0 to k

I need a constraint expression that counts unique pairs between these 2
arrays

f.e I want constraint count(a, b, {1, 2}, 3) to hold if there are 3 pairs
of values 1, 2 on the same index, what I do now is introducing a new
variable called classes

for (int i = 0; i < n; i++)
{
    classes[i] = expr(*this, a[i] * k + b[i]);
}

where classes variable is different for different pairs, and after I apply
counting constraint on it, but I feel like there should be a better solution

I have an IntVarArgs value of length n and I want to push a constraint that
each value in array appears at least k times (or 0) f.e array [1, 2, 3, 1,
2, 3, 4, 4, 4] satisfies this constraint with k = 2

what I do now is

for (int i = 0; i < n; i++){

However, as n grows, the number of constraints grows, but I feel like it
could be expressed by a single constraint. I also think that closure of
array to itself is not optimal for the solver.

Is there any other solutions for this?

Please read in MPG about the global cardinality constraint (which in Gecode is also called count). It is exactly what you are looking for.

Hi.
I?m new to this list and ?almost new? to mini zinc and all its surrounding projects, including gecode.
I?ve seen in this mailing list archive that a time limit when running gecode from the CLI can be set appending 
--fzn-flags "-time 2000"
to the command line.

I understand I?m a bit OT here, but I assume many gecode users also use g12mip (I come from a PhD in Operations Research, so MIP is my main background, though I?m investigating more and more often CP as well)?
Why does this option not work when launching g12mip?
Can anybody give me a hint on how to set a time limit when I select this solver engine instead of gecode to solve a minizinc mip model?

Thank you

Can anybody give me a hint on how to set a time limit when I select this solver engine instead of gecode to solve a minizinc mip model?

 

Thank you

Mmh. So, my assumption that gecode experts are also experts in the other
solvers included in mini zinc is wrong... ?
Thank you for your answer anyway.
I've just posted this question there too. ??

Regards.

Good luck! Me, expert in anything. You must be kidding ;-) Christian

Hi.

I?m new to this list and ?almost new? to mini zinc and all its surrounding projects, including gecode.

I?ve seen in this mailing list archive that a time limit when running gecode from the CLI can be set appending 

--fzn-flags "-time 2000"

to the command line.

 

I understand I?m a bit OT here, but I assume many gecode users also use g12mip (I come from a PhD in Operations Research, so MIP is my main background, though I?m investigating more and more often CP as well)?

Why does this option not work when launching g12mip?

Can anybody give me a hint on how to set a time limit when I select this solver engine instead of gecode to solve a minizinc mip model?

 

Thank you
