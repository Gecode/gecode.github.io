Hi Christian,

sorry for taking long to respond. I read the manual and tried to modify the
engines to do what I wanted. Unfortunately, I was not succesfull...

My first attempt was to run BAB until completion with the long steps
(adding chunks of constraints in the constrain() function). I was then
hoping that I should be able to modify the last solution returned by BAB
(by setting a parameter in the corresponding object,
lastSolution->setLargeChunks(false), to influence the behavior of the
constrain function in the future), and create and run a new BAB with this
solution object as initial object. (something like BAB<...> e(lastSolution,
options) ). Although it does run, I get the feeling that it starts the
search from the beginning and does not benefit from the search done so far.

I then tried to understand how to modify the parallel engine code, but it
was beyond my capabilities...

Thanks,
Dirk

Hi Dirk,

 

Hmm, if it is as you say that?s surprising: you say that you create a new BAB engine. That engine would restart from whatever you give it as space, so it will start from the last solution. So that should in fact work? Why do you think it starts from scratch? >From what I understand you do not even have to modify the engine, changing the constrain() function is enough, right?

 

Don?t look at the parallel stuff that?s awful ;-) 

 

Cheers

Christian

Thanks, Christian.

 

You were, of course, correct. BAB does the job and my code is now much more elegant than before. It also works well to combine with RBS.  

 

However, my earlier code was sometimes faster. The reason is that I could take "large steps", adding constraints in chunks until the search failed. I  could then go back to the last feasible model and add constraints one by one instead of in chunks.

Is something similar possible in the gecode search engines? What I would like do is  the following: I run BAB until fail, and then "reset the state of the engine" to where it was when it produced the last feasible solution ("before my last call to the constrain function", so to speak). I would then re-run the search from there (with another behavior of the constrain function).

Hence, you will have to reimplement the master function, there you just add the additional constraints.

 

Have you thought about using BAB? There, each time you find a solution you can add new constraints based on that solution _without_ restarting search. Sounds more like it to me.

Hello - 

 

I am trying to do program up a search engine that performs sequential refinement by adding more and more constraints to a model. In the first run, I am happy with a solution at all, but then I want to add increasingly complex constraints until there is no more solution (or the search engine times out).

 

Now, I first run a model with a single constraint. If DFS can find a solution, then I run a completely new model with two constraints and from scratch. If this model is feasible, then I run the model with three constraints, etc.

 

In principle, this solution works, but it is a very inefficient: a lot of time is spent generating the first feasible solution when restarting the search (especially as the problem becomes more constrained). 

 

It seems to me that this should be doable with RBS or a variation of the LDS engine, as described in the MPG. But there are very few examples to follow (the closest I found was this question posted on stack overflow  <http://stackoverflow.com/questions/34182681/how-to-change-the-variable-value-ordering-in-gecodes-restart-based-search> http://stackoverflow.com/questions/34182681/how-to-change-the-variable-value-ordering-in-gecodes-restart-based-search but unfortunately it does not contain any answer). I simply cannot understand how to do it right. In particular, where do I post additional constraint on the model (in the master space, the slave space or elsewhere)? 

 

Any leads on how to do it, or links to code that adds constraints or changes branching order in RBS would be appreciated!

Yes, that looks like a version problem. Unfortunately, I am not using clang for development. Guido, can you comment here?

Message-ID: <b9cf0aee2457914def3aaffe2b716752@michalfilippi.net>

Hi,
for my student work I need to work with CPSP tool which requires GECODE 
in version 1.3.

But I'm having a hard time installing this older version. Every time I 
run 'make' command I get two groups of errors.

First group contains several instances of shadowing variable. These 
errors I was able to fix by simply renaming one of the variables.
Example of one instance:

./gecode/int/count.hh:243:32: error: declaration of ?bool shr?
      BaseView(Space* home, bool shr, BaseView& p);

./gecode/int/count.hh:231:43: error:  shadows template parm ?bool shr?
    template <class VX, class VY, class VZ, bool shr>

Second group of errors contains calling of undefined function.

./gecode/int/count/view.icc: In instantiation of ?static 
Gecode::ExecStatus Gecode::Int::Count::EqView<VX, VY, VZ, 
shr>::post(Gecode::Space*, Gecode::ViewArray<View>&, VY, VZ, int) [with

./gecode/int/count/view.icc:127:16: error: ?sharing? was not declared in 
this scope, and no declarations were found by argument-dependent lookup 
at the point of instantiation [-fpermissive]
      if (sharing(x,y,z))
./gecode/int/count/view.icc:127:16: note: declarations in dependent base

Gecode::Int::ConstIntView, Gecode::Int::IntView, true>? are not found by 
unqualified lookup
./gecode/int/count/view.icc:127:16: note: use ?EqView::sharing? instead

I have no idea how to fix these errors.

I tried two different version of compiler, g++ 4.6.4 and 5.4.0. Both 
with the exact same result.
I used Ubuntu 16.04.

Thank you in advance for any help.

Try to pass -fpermissive as additional compiler flag (make CXXUSR=-fpermissive). The other issue could be fixed by renaming.

The issue comes from the fact the gcc versions are too new: they are now stricter than they used to be. But 1.3.1 is so old, we will not do any fixing there.

First group contains several instances of shadowing variable. These errors I was able to fix by simply renaming one of the variables.
Example of one instance:

./gecode/int/count.hh:243:32: error: declaration of ?bool shr?
      BaseView(Space* home, bool shr, BaseView& p);

./gecode/int/count.hh:231:43: error:  shadows template parm ?bool shr?
    template <class VX, class VY, class VZ, bool shr>

Second group of errors contains calling of undefined function.

./gecode/int/count/view.icc: In instantiation of ?static Gecode::ExecStatus Gecode::Int::Count::EqView<VX, VY, VZ, 
shr>::post(Gecode::Space*, Gecode::ViewArray<View>&, VY, VZ, int) [with
VX = Gecode::Int::IntView; VY = Gecode::Int::ConstIntView; VZ = 
Gecode::Int::IntView; bool shr = true]?:gecode/int/count.cc:108:7:   
required from here
./gecode/int/count/view.icc:127:16: error: ?sharing? was not declared in this scope, and no declarations were found by argument-dependent lookup at the point of instantiation [-fpermissive]
      if (sharing(x,y,z))
./gecode/int/count/view.icc:127:16: note: declarations in dependent base ?Gecode::Int::Count::BaseView<Gecode::Int::IntView,
Gecode::Int::ConstIntView, Gecode::Int::IntView, true>? are not found by unqualified lookup
./gecode/int/count/view.icc:127:16: note: use ?EqView::sharing? instead

I have no idea how to fix these errors.

I tried two different version of compiler, g++ 4.6.4 and 5.4.0. Both with the exact same result.
I used Ubuntu 16.04.

Thank you in advance for any help.
