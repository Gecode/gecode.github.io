Subject: [gecode-users] incomplete output from fan-gecode
Message-ID: <CAE55_MhGw8yyjWGgQmUzMG09ks58PmF3r_Gw89YYNZ3LzvQhzw@mail.gmail.com>

Hello all,
I have come across (what seems to be) a bug in fzn-gecode, and was
wondering if anyone had any ideas about how to work around it.

Here is a tiny example to demonstrate the problem. Take the following
csp.mzn:

var int: a;
var int: b;
contraint a = 1;
constraint a = b;
solve satisfy;

And then run:

mzn2fzn csp.mzn
fzn-gecode csp.fzn

The output is:

a = 1;
----------

The problem is that the value of variable b is not printed. However, piping
the output of fzn-gecode into solns2out does give the complete output.

The first complication is that I don't want to use solns2out. I'm
using fzn-gecode to find all the solutions to a csp, and after a few hours
of running, the memory usage of solns2out is over 60GB. The program grinds
to a halt (or crashes).

And secondly, I don't have much control over the contents of the csp, as it
is being automatically generated (from a PDDL planning domain).

Does anyone know how I might get the complete output from fzn-gecode
without using solns2out?

Thanks
Max
