Subject: [gecode-users] dynamic cost calculation
Message-ID: <487891458.12436.1523292790452.JavaMail.www@wwinf1t14>

Hello,

I've a problem solved with gecode where jobs must be assigned to person.
Each (job, person) has it own cost statically given. The implementation
looks like :
// --------------------------------------------------------------
   _j(*this, _nb_jobs, 0, _nb_persons - 1)
 
   int _cost[] =
      {
         9,  2,  7,  8,
         6,  4,  3,  7,
         5,  8,  1,  8,
         7,  6,  9,  4,
      };
 
   IntArgs cost(_nb_persons*_nb_jobs, _cost);
   distinct(*this, _j);
 
   for (int i = 0 ; i < _nb_jobs ; ++i)
   {
      C << expr(*this, element(cost_m.col(i), _j[i]));
  }
   _total_cost = expr(*this, sum(C));
   JobBrancher::post(*this, _j);
// --------------------------------------------------------------  
 
The problem is that the _cost must be precomputed. To enable a dynamic
cost computation (and to prepare futher improvement),
i've modified the code this way  :
      
// --------------------------------------------------------------
   _cost(*this, _nb_persons, 0, 10)  // a IntVarArray
   JobBrancher::post(*this, _j, _cost, _nb_jobs, _nb_persons);
// --------------------------------------------------------------
  
And :
1) compute dynamically the cost in JobBrancher::choice
2) call me_failed(_costs_views[choice._person].eq(home, choice._cost))
   In JobBrancher::commit (for job/person affectation)
3) call me_failed(_jobs_views[choice._job].eq(home, choice._person))
   In JobBrancher::commit (to compute the _total_cost)
  
The problem is that solution can be found without having an
assigned cost. This produce a Int::ValOfUnassignedVar as stated
in MPG.
 
I've tried to set all unassigned cost in JobBrancher::commit
(not only the one corresponding to the choice person/job)
just to make a try but it doesn't work :
 
// --------------------------------------------------------------
for(int i = 0 ; i < choice._costs.size() ; ++i)
{
   const JobChoice::Info & elem = choice._costs[i];
   const int p = elem.person;
   const int c = elem.cost;
 
   if (! _costs_views[p].assigned())
   {
      has_failed = me_failed(_costs_views[p].eq(home, c));
      if (has_failed)
      {
         return Gecode::ES_FAILED;
      }
   }
}
 
return Gecode::ES_OK;
// --------------------------------------------------------------
 
The first affectation seems to works. After that, i see under gist
that the first branch is infinitely explored without any change.
Can someone explain me what i'm doing wrong and how to correct it ?
 
Thanks
Philippe.

Subject: [gecode-users] Can a propagator hide domain wipe-out of a variable?
Message-ID: <1698a177-7af6-37c5-fef3-dbd09bb930b5@math.uni-goettingen.de>

Dear list

I consider using "conditional variables", i.e., similar to "conditional
constraints" (a.k.a. reified constraints), I want to have a set (array)
of variables among which only (exactly) one will be actually "active" in
any solution, selected by another variable (call it the "selection"
variable), and only the active/selected one has to fulfill its
constraints. Now I would implement propagators that are aware of this,
and when their propagation finds out that one of the candidates from the
conditional variables has no possible values left in its domain (via
pruning its view completely, resulting in a "failed" modification
event), then, instead of failing the current space, the propagator
should "hide" this failure and instead prune this candidate from the
domain of the selection variable.

Is this a possible way to go in Gecode? If I understand MPG, page 310,
correctly, this should be possible, since it's the propagator's
obligation to report any failure. However, in chapter 25, reification is
not implemented by checking for some ME_FAIL, but rather by inspecting
the domain individually (which is easy in bounds propagation, but seems
unnecessarily intricate in case of domain propagation).
Furthermore, is there an existing name for this concept (like there is
"reification" on constraints)? Maybe it really is just reification in
disguise.

Regards
Sebastian

Hi, no you can't do that. If a variable operation returns failure, the propagator _must_ report failure as well. This has to do with the fact that the variable domain in most cases has been modified in a way that violates certain invariants. The only thing you can do with a variable like that is inspect it.

Cheers
Christian

Hi,

The mistakes was easy to solve since I have simply forgotten to

retrieve the return value of a me_failed call.

Bye.

Message-ID: <f2de1d67-3afe-369b-1ada-95a799bbc4a2@orange.fr>

Hello, I developed a custom brancher that works as expected. However, 
sometimes a choice is made that leads to lot of failures. When this 
situation occurs, I would like to call an external function that decides 
whether or not the subtree should fail. I don't think afc or cutoff can 
help here. Am I wrong ? Thank you for your help.

hi,

here is some simple example code:

                FloatVar x (*this, -100, 100);
                FloatVar t1 = expr (*this, abs (x * 100)); // OK
                FloatVar t2 = expr (*this, abs (x) * 100); // NOK

variable t1 doesn't cause a problem
when creating variable t2, an exception is thrown (OutOfLimits(
"Float::linear"))

the same code compiled with gecode 4.3.2 doesn't cause problems.

am I doing something wrong?

Kind Regards,

Hi, hmm that?s a bug. There has been a change in Gecode 6 for FloatVal (if used as coefficients in linear constraints which expr creates, they are not allowed to extend from negative to positive and include zero) but not for FloatVar. I?ll have a look sometime this week and get back to you.

Cheers

Message-ID: <05b3b1e5-d65f-e7e6-342b-16a14b3aa292@htwk-leipzig.de>

Hi,


I am trying to convert some code that was written
for gecode-3 API up to 6.

The original code is here:
https://github.com/JTiko/monadiccp-gecode/blob/master/Control/CP/FD/Gecode/Interface.hsc

So far, I have this (ICL => IPL, omit "share", add () to some macros -
but this is already guesswork on my part)
https://github.com/jwaldmann/monadiccp-gecode/commit/0ddf6630597b1c734ddcc178cf586b3fd6626b0c

I am now seeing a lot of errors like these:

no matching function for call to ?branch(HaskellModel&,
Gecode::BoolVarArgs&, Gecode::IntVarBranch, Gecode::IntValBranch)?
...
note:   candidate expects 2 arguments, 4 provided

and I don't know how to fix this. I guess
http://www.gecode.org/doc-latest/reference/PageHowToChange__4.html
is related but I still don't see what to do. Any hints?


On the other hand (This is a separate issue) perhaps I shouldn't.
My motivation is that I want to write Haskell, not C++,
but still use the power of gecode. The "monadic-cp" approach
does look really nice, e.g., note how "exists $ \ y -> ..." creates
a Haskell name (not a string), in
https://github.com/JTiko/monadiccp-gecode/blob/master/examples/LangfordNumber.hs

Perhaps go via minizinc? But that looks like a lot more work
(a fresh back-end for monadic-cp). I am hoping that the API issue
mentioned above could be fixed more easily.


- J.


PS: I tried to run this on travis to show exact build errors
but they only have gecode-5 (in their docker images),
and building 6 from source takes too long (I think they kill the job)

Hi, I think I got this working. The actual error was
that a branch on BoolVars had IntVar control parameters.
To give some more context:

The "Monadic Constraint Programming Framework" (Schrijvers et al.)
http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/summary?doi=10.1.1.184.9140
https://doi.org/10.1017/S0956796809990086
is a way of representing constraint systems and search strategies
via a DSL that is embedded in (i.e., uses the syntax and semantics,
in particular the type system, of) Haskell.
Gecode can be used as a back-end
https://lirias.kuleuven.be/handle/123456789/242221

The implementation
http://hackage.haskell.org/package/monadiccp-gecode
was bit-rotted. I updated it to work
with current Gecode (6.0.0) and Haskell compiler (ghc-8.2.2)
(working test case in this CI build
https://travis-ci.org/jwaldmann/monadiccp-gecode/builds/372165385 )
Source is at https://github.com/jwaldmann/monadiccp-gecode
and we'll see about publishing this on hackage soon.
