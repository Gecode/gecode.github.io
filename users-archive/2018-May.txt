Hi,

Finally I had some time to look into this problem. This is unfortunately not that easy to fix, I have to do some thinking here and/or inspect a number of constraints... For example, the abs constraint is one broken bastard ;-(

The behavior in 4.3.2 has been buggy (it really leads to overflow which was silently ignored).

Cheers
Christian

Subject: [gecode-users] gecode 6 exception

hi,

here is some simple example code:

                FloatVar x (*this, -100, 100);
                FloatVar t1 = expr (*this, abs (x * 100)); // OK
                FloatVar t2 = expr (*this, abs (x) * 100); // NOK

variable t1 doesn't cause a problem
when creating variable t2, an exception is thrown (OutOfLimits("Float::linear"))

the same code compiled with gecode 4.3.2 doesn't cause problems.

am I doing something wrong?

Kind Regards,
