<PRE>This might depend on the dictionary you are using. Check whether it contains words with the corresponding letters. Note that you can give your own dictionary as a file, check examples/crossword.cpp that comes with Gecode.

Anyway, I would not overwrite the variables but constraint them such as in
  rel(*this, ml(10,5) == &#8216;f&#8217;);
and so on.

Cheers
Christian

Subject: [gecode-users] GECODE: Crosswords with two constraints, set letters and black cells

Hi all,

I am having a look at the examples of crosswords in Gecode. I am doing this for a gift. So the satisfaction of getting it done would be even greater!

I would like to add another set of constraints, not just black cells but also specific letters on the grid (which I would like to use to arrange a secret message that the receiver will read after having solved the crossword).

I tried this (just an example):

IntVar letter1(*this, 'f', 'f');
ml(10, 5) = letter1;
IntVar letter2(*this, 'i', 'i');
ml(9, 4) = letter2;

Running the example of Figure 22.2 of the documentation (Chapter 22) works fine if I impose only two constraints like the above, but everything already collapses if I try to set three letters.

Do you think what I am thinking of is feasible? I mean, I would like to fix 20 or 30 letters on a 22x15 grid, but it seems that I am not even close to getting a solution.

I am trying to read through the documentation but by scarcity of time I am not sure if I am trying the impossible or simply I have to tweak other parameters.

Could you please help me?

Cheers,
Andrea
