Hi,

I have a problem with the installation of gecode. I'm using cygwin in windows xp. I use DJGPP (gpp) to compile my C++ programs. To configure gecode I use: ./configure CC="gcc -mno-cygwin" CXX="g++ -mno-cygwin". This produces the following error: C++ compiler can not create executables. If I simply use ./configure a MakeFile is produced. However, make does not work.

What can I do to properly configure and compile gecode?

Thanks,

Dhananjay
