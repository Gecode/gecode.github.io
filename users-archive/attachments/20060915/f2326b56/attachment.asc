Hi All,

I have a question about how I could implement a disjunction constraint in gecode. For example, if I have a interger variable x[0...20] and I want to post a constraint x<=5 || x>=6, how would I do this? I have seen the operator||() command which works with boolean variables, can the disjunction be achieved by extending this?
