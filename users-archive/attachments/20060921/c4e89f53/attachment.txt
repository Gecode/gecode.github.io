Hi All,

I have a problem with the disjunctions in gecode. If I have a variable x (0...5) and I post the following constraint:
tt(x>2 || x>3)

I would expect now x (3...5), but the domains do not change. Also is
there a way to say:
b1 = 1 if x>2
b2 = 1 if x>3,

then I could use operator||(b1,b2) and reduce the domain to x(3...5).

Thanks,

Dhananjay
