Hi all,

I'm implementing a scheduling problem with start (s), duration (d), end(e), setup times, for n jobs. I would like to find the minimum scheduling time from s[0] to s[n-1] and e[0] to e[n-1]. I have set it up such that e[n-1] contains the largest time point and I have attempted BAB with constrain to minimize e[n-1]. I realize that this only attempts different values for e[n-1] and does not try different branchings for the s and e variables. How can I do this, i.e., try different branchings to find a minimum?

Regards,

Dhananjay
