Hi All,

I have a problem with checking the domain values of variables after
posting constraints. This is an example of the code I have:

  IntVarArray x(this,5,0,4);
  distinct(this, x, ICL_DOM);
  IntVar x1(this,0,0);
  x[0]=x1;
  post(this,x[0]=x1);
  unsigned long int p;
  (void) status(p); // should update the domains?

I would expect x[0] = 0, x[1]=x[2]=x[3]=x[4]= 1...4, but I get x[1]=...=
0...4. So the domains don't seem to be pruned but this should happen,
correct?

Regards,

Dhananjay
