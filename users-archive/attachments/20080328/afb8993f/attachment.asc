Hi all,

I've got the following problem when I try to execute programs:

error when loading libraries: libgecodesearch.so.12: cannot open shared object file: No such file or directory

This also happens with the examples. When linking libraries statically, I get the following error when I compile:

/usr/bin/ld: cannot find -lgecodesearch

I am running gcc 4.1.3 on ubuntu 7.10 and gecode-2.1.1. Any tips on how I can sort this out will be great. Thanks.

Dhananjay
